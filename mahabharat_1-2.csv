1,Adi Parv,Maharaja Shantanu Marries the Celestial Ganga,"According to the historical records of this earth, there once lived a King named Maharaja Shantanu, the son of Pratipa, who took his birth in the solar dynasty and was considered naradeva, the manifest representative of the Supreme Lord on earth. His fame and rule extended to all parts of the world. The qualities of self-control, liberality, forgiveness, intelligence, modesty, patience and power always resided this exalted emperor. His neck was marked with three lines like a conchshell, and his shoulders were broad. In prowess He resembled a maddened elephant. Above all these qualities, he was a devoted servant of Lord Vishnu, and therefore he was given the title, ""King of kings"".
Once when Maharaja Shantanu, that bull among men, was wandering in the forest, he came upon a place frequented by the Siddhas and Charanas (a class of heavenly demigods). There he saw an angelic woman who appeared like the goddess of fortune herself. In truth, she was the personification of the river Ganges. She was glancing at the monarch with her youthful longing eyes, and Maharaja Shantanu became attracted to her. He then approached her inquiring, ""O beautiful woman, are you from the race of the Gandharvas, Apsaras, Yakshas, Nagas or the human race? As yet I have no queen, and your birth appears divine. Whatever your origin, O celestial beauty, I request you to become my wife.""
The beautiful apsara (celestial maiden) then smilingly replied, ""O King, I shall become your wife and obey your commands, but there are certain conditions. You should not interfere with my actions, whether agreeable or disagreeable. Also you should never chastise me with harsh words. If you assent to my request, I shall live with you.  The King, infatuated with love, agreed to her proposals.
Having taken the lovely Ganga for his wife, Maharaja Shantanu passed many years in her association. She satisfied the King by her charm and affection, as well as by her music and dance; and thus the King passed many seasons unconscious of time. While enjoying himself in her company, he conceived eight children by her that were equal in quality to the heavenly gods. However, on the birth of each child, Ganga threw them into the river, exclaiming, ""This is for your good!  The King was not pleased with his wife's conduct, but he dared not speak a chastising word, lest she leave his company. However, when the eighth child was born, the King could not tolerate the killing of another child and he spoke harshly, ""Do not kill this child! Why do you kill your own children? O murderess of your sons, the reaction to such sin is very great!
When reproached in these words, the celestial beauty replied, ""I shall not cast this child into the river, but according to our marriage agreement, our relationship has ended. I am Ganga, the personification of the River Ganges, and I am ever-worshipped by the great sages and common people. My origin is the divine feet of Lord Vishnu. I have lived with you only to accomplish the purpose of the demigods. The eight Vasus were cursed by Vashistha Muni, and thus they have appeared on earth as a reaction to that curse. They have pleaded wth me to free them from this bondage immediately after their birth. I have lived with you long enough to fulfill my promise to the Vasus. This last child is destined to live on earth for some time. His name will be Devavrata, and he shall be famous as a lion among men.
Maharaja Shantanu then inquired from his wife, ""What offense did the Vasu's commit for which they were born on earth as human beings? Why, also, is this last child destined to live on earth longer than the others? O Ganga, my wife, please clarify this.
 Being thus questioned by the King of the earth, Ganga replied to the Monarch, ""O best of the Bharata race, on Mount Meru there are many picturesque forests. In one such wooded region lives a renowned sage named Vashistha Muni. He is adept in the practice of austerity and meditation. With the help of his Kamadhenu cow, he performs sacrifices to please the Supreme Being. One , the eight Vasus headed by Prithu came to that forest. Roaming about with their wives, the Vasus entered the hermitage of Vashistha Muni. At that time they spotted the celestial cow named Nandini. One of the Vasus, whose name was Dyu, then informed his wife, This cow belongs to the eminent sage Vashistha, and it is said that the mortal who drinks the milk of this cow remains unchanged for ten thousand years.' Turning to her husband she replied, I have a very dear friend named Jitavati who is the daughter of the sage Usinara. I wish to take this cow and calf as a present for her.' When repeatedly petitioned by his beautiful wife, Dyu, along with his brothers, abducted the Kamadhenu cow, forgetting who was the actual owner.
That evening, when Vashistha returned to his hermitage, he could not find his Kamadhenu cow or its calf. He began to search the forest, but nowhere could they be found. By his mystic power, obtained by long years of austerity, he then understood that the cow and its calf had been taken away by the Vasus. When the sage's wrath was kindled, he cursed the Vasus, Because the Vasus have stolen my Kamadhenu cow, I curse them to be born on earth as ordinary mortals.' The sage then returned to his practice of ascetic meditation.
""When the Vasus heard of Vashistha's curse, they came to his hermitage to pacify him. They praised him with amiable words and offered to return the cow. However, they failed to obtain clemency from the great sage. The great brahmana Vashistha, who is naturally kind to everyone, then compassionately said, This curse is the suitable punishment to rectify your enjoying mentality. You will be freed from it shortly after your earthly birth. However, your brother Dyu, who actually stole my cow, shall have to domicile on earth for a long period of time. Dyu, though living on earth, shall not marry and have children. He will, however, be a man of kingly virtue and will know the essence of the holy scriptures. He will be an obedient servitor to his father, but will have to live without female companionship.'
""The Vasus  Ganga continued, ""then came to me and begged a benediction. They asked that I cast them into the waters of the Ganges immediately upon taking their birth. O best among kings, I have fulfilled their desire, but this last child, Dyu, will have to reside on earth for some time to fulfill the curse of Vashistha Muni.  Having related the Vasus' history, Ganga disappeared with the child, and the King returned to his palace with a sorrowful heart."
2,Adi Parv,Maharaja Shantanu and Devavrata,"Many, many years passed, and Maharaja Shantanu had to learn to live in separation from his wife and son. One  while chasing a deer along the bank of the Ganges, the King noticed that the river had become shallow. He had never seen this before, and he sought the cause. While searching along the river bank, he spotted a handsome, powerful, and heroic youth. The boy was releasing celestial weapons impeding the flow of the Ganges. This young boy was Maharaja Shantanu's son, whom he had not seen since the boy was born. However, the King could not recognize him as such because he had only seen his son for a few moments after his birth. The youth, upon seeing his father, knew him to be so and out of shyness disappeared from sight.
King Shantanu was struck with wonder and imagined that the youth might be his own son. He then continued down the river bank, and there he saw Ganga whom he had not seen in years. As he approached her, he saw the same boy standing at her side. She then informed the king, ""O best among kings, our eighth child is standing next to me. His name is Devavrata. He has been trained in the heavenly planets and has knowledge of all the celestial weapons of warfare. Devavrata has been the student of Vashistha Muni, who has taught our son the Vedas and their branches. O descendent of Bharata, both the demigods and the demons look upon him with favor. Whatever knowledge the sage Brihaspati has learned, this child has also learned, and whatever weapons the powerful and great Parashurama possess, this boy also possesses. Now that his training is complete, you may take Devavrata and raise him as your own.  Thus commanded by Ganga, Devavrata accompanied Maharaja Shantanu to his capital city.
 Maharaja Shantanu became attached to the boy who was endowed with all good qualities. Devavrata also became attached to his father, and it was seen that the two were always together. They talked together, walked together, ate together, slept together, and hunted together. Indeed, they were almost inseparable. Four years passed in this way.
One , the King entered the forest along the bank of the Yamuna. While roaming in that region, he perceived a sweet aroma coming from an unknown direction. He followed the scent, and while wandering here and there, he came across a woman of heavenly beauty. Her name was Satyavati, and she was the daughter of a fisherman. He was pierced by the arrows of Cupid, and desiring her for his wife, he inquired, ""Who are you, and who is your father? Also, please tell me what you are doing here.  Replying to the King she said, ""My name is Satyavati, and I am the daughter of the fishermen King. My father has engaged me in the pious activity of rowing passengers across the river Yamuna.
Bewildered by the beauty and charm of this girl, the King approached the fisherman and spoke to him of a proposed marriage. The fisherman replied, ""My daughter certainly could not find a more suitable husband than yourself. However, you must fulfill my one desire. I wish that the son born of my daughter be the next king of the world, and no one else can become your successor.
When that great descendant of Bharata heard the terms for gaining Satyavati, he felt no desire to grant such a benediction, and thus he returned to his capital. While riding on his chariot, he constantly thought of the beautiful fisherman's daughter. With a sorrowful heart, he entered his palace and did not say a word to anyone, not even Devavrata. Upon seeing his father's unhappiness, Devavrata approached him inquiring, ""Please tell me father why you are so unhappy? You have not spoken a word to me, nor have you performed your daily duties. Please reveal the cause of your distress, and I will find a cure for it.
When requested in these words, Maharaja Shantanu replied, ""My dear son, I am thinking of the instability of human life. If sudden death were to overcome you, I would be without a son. You are like a hundred sons to me, and I do not desire to marry again. I only desire that our dynasty be perpetuated. The wise say that he who has one son has no son at all. It is quite possible that you will be slain on the battle field, and if that happens, what will be the state of the Bharata dynasty? It is these thoughts that have made me so unhappy.
Devavrata was intelligent and reflected on his father's words. He felt there was something more than his father had revealed. He then went to the King's chariot driver and questioned him about the cause of the monarch's sullen mood. The charioteer told Devavrata about the fisherman's daughter and the benediction sought by her father. Understanding the situation, Devavrata, accompanied by some of the family elders, went to the fisherman's cottage. The chief of the fishermen greeted Devavrata, offering him a seat. He then informed him in sweet words, ""O son of Shantanu, I welcome you for you are the pride of the kshatriya race. You are certainly invincible, but I have something to tell you. Even if the future husband of my daughter were to be Indra himself, he would have to lament, for the requirements for marrying Satyavati apply to all. Many sages have told me that your father is the only suitable husband for Satyavati. I have even rejected the requests of the great rishis in the matter of her marriage. The one great obstacle to this marriage is that you will be crowned King and not the son born of Satyavati and Shantanu. This is all I have to say in the matter.
Understanding the fisherman's desire, Devavrata meditated on the situation, and wanting to benefit his father, he informed the fisherman, ""O fisherman, listen to my vow. There has not been, nor will there ever be born a man who can make this vow. I shall fulfill your request. I take the vow that the son born from Satyavati and my father shall be king, and I shall relinquish my claim to the throne.
Upon hearing Devavrata's promise, the fisherman, who sought sole sovereignty for Satyavati's son, said, ""This vow that you have taken will certainly come to pass, but I have one doubt that is still in my mind. What will happen to your children? They may also claim the throne.  Devavrata replied, ""O chief among fishermen, listen to the vow I shall make in the presence of these assembled elders. I have already relinquished my claim to the throne, and now I shall settle the matter of my descendants. I shall adopt the vow of brahmacharya and agree never to marry.
Hearing the oath spoken by Devavrata, the hair on the fisherman's body stood on end, and he promised, ""I shall hand over my daughter to Shantanu.  When Devavrata made this vow, the heavenly denizens showered flowers, and the firmament was filled with the sounds, ""This one shall be known as Bhishma [one who has taken a difficult vow].  The only sounds heard were ""Bhishma!, Bhishma!, This one shall be called Bhishma!
Ganga's son then took Satyavati on the chariot and returned to Hastinapura. When Maharaja Shantanu heard about the oath his son had taken, he was pleased and gave him a benediction, ""You shall never experience death as long as you wish to live. Indeed, you will die only when you desire it.  Thus Satyavati was married to Maharaja Shantanu, and that glorious King accepted her into his palace and maintained her as she desired."
3,Adi Parv,Bhishma Abducts Three Princesses,"In due course, Maharaja Shantanu's Queen, Satyavati, bore a highly qualified son named Chitrangada. He was blessed with invincible power and was destined to become a renowned archer. Later, another son was born to Satyavati, named Vichitravirya. He developed into a natural leader and heroic warrior. As the two sons grew to maturity, they brought joy to the King and Queen. Soon Maharaja Shantanu found himself growing old, and seeing the influence of inevitable time, he decided to retire to the forest to practice austerities for realizing the kingdom of God. Before entering the forest, Maharaja Shantanu enthroned Chitrangada as the world's king under Bhishma's protection. He then departed to the forest alone to perform penances and austerities. Maharaja Shantanu soon became absorbed in trance and realized his original relationship with the Lord in the kingdom of God. When his meditation upon the Lord's transcendental form was unbroken, he ascended to the spiritual world.
When Chitrangada became King, he soon challenged and eliminated all opponents on the planet earth. Indeed, all the earthly kings considered that there was no kshatriya equal to him. Nevertheless, in the heavenly planets there lived a Gandharva King whose name was also Chitrangada. Upon hearing that an earthly being bore his name and was considered invincible, he challenged the son of Satyavati. There then took place on the field of Kurukshetra a battle that endured for a full three years. Both Chitrangadas were powerful, and the battle was fierce, but in the end the Kuru prince was slain. The King of the Gandharvas then ascended to the heavenly planets satisfied at heart. After the death of his step brother, Bhishma performed the last funeral rites and then enthroned Vichitravirya as the world's emperor, although he was only a small boy. Until Vichitravirya matured in age, Bhishma ruled the kingdom. Maharaja Bhishma took care of Vichitravirya like a father, arranging for the education and military training of the future king.
When Maharaja Bhishma saw that Vichitravirya was of marriageable age, he thought of obtaining a queen for him. At this time he heard that in the kingdom of Kashi three daughters were being offered in marriage. These princesses had heavenly beauty, and it was known that they were to select their own husbands. Bhishma went alone in his chariot to the city of Varanasi, and there he saw countless monarches who had assembled hoping to wed one of the princesses. The names of those beautiful girls were Amba, Ambika and Ambalika. While the daughters of the King were being introduced to the assembled heroic princes, Bhishma stood up in the assembly and commanded, ""The wise have declared that when a qualified person has been invited to a svayamvara, a maiden may be bestowed upon him. There are eight kinds of marriage ceremonies, but the wise highly applaud that a princess taken by force in the presence of competitors is the foremost svayamvara. Therefore, strive to your best ability to defeat me or be defeated.
After challenging the assembled kings and princes, Bhishma put the three princesses on his chariot and proceeded to leave the Kashi kingdom. The kshatriya princes then stood up and, in great fury, challenged Bhishma to a fight. They put on their armour and pursued him in great haste. Attacking Ganga's son with full force, they poured a thick deluge of arrows upon him. Maharaja Bhishma, however, nullified those arrows with his own, and then pierced each prince with three shafts.The princes in turn pierced Bhishma with many arrows, and then released javelins and darts hoping to encompass his death. The battle was fought with such intense fury that even those who were courageous became struck with fear. Keeping his bow drawn in a constant circle, Bhishma severed arrows, bows, flagstaffs, coats of armor and human heads by the hundreds. The son of Ganga defeated the supporting armies that opposed him, and those who were heroes applauded the prowess of such a great warrior. When Shantanu's son had crushed all opponents, he proceeded to the Kuru kingdom, taking with him the three heavenly princesses.
While Maharaja Bhishma was proceeding toward Hastinapura, King Salwa, whose prowess was famed, suddenly appeared from behind. He challenged Bhishma, ""Wait!, Wait!  Bhishma flamed up in anger and turned to meet the challenge of the oncoming monarch. All the princes, who had been defeated, assembled to see the battle between those two bulls among men. King Salwa first covered Bhishma with many golden arrows. All the assembled princes applauded Salwa's prowess, but Bhishma was furious and told his charioteer, ""Take me closer to Salwa's chariot, so I may kill him in the way Garuda kills a serpent.  The Kuru chief then fixed the varuna weapon to his bow, and releasing it put Salwa's horses into confusion. This weapon caused a tidal wave to appear. Showing his supremacy with the bow, Bhishma released a flaming arrow which killed Salwa's charioteer. The powerful son of Shantanu then released the aindra weapon which killed Salwa's horses. (This weapon is similar to a modern  machine gun, but is more powerful and more accurate.) As the battle continued, Bhishma shattered all the weapons of Salwa, but left him with his life. After defeating all opponents, Bhishma proceeded to Hastinapura and offered the beautiful princesses to his younger brother.
After performing this uncommon exploit, Bhishma arranged the marriage ceremony for Vichitravirya. At that time the eldest daughter of the Kashi King, whose name was Amba, approached Bhishma appealing to him, ""At heart I had chosen King Salwa as my husband. He had in his heart chosen me for his wife. This was also approved by my father. At the svayamvara in Kashi I would have garlanded him and accepted him as my lord if you had not forcibly taken me away. You are aware of moral principles, so please decide whether I am free to go.  Bhishma deliberated for some time, and after consulting with qualified brahmanas, he decided that Amba could return to the kingdom of Kashi and marry the lord of her heart.
The other two princesses, Ambika and Ambalika, who were as beautiful as the heavenly denizens, accepted Vichitravirya as their husband and considered themselves very fortunate. They considered him a worthy husband, and loved and respected him in every way. Vichitravirya was endowed with the prowess of the devas and could steal away the heart of any woman. Thus King Vichitravirya was duly married to the princesses of Kashi, and he passed seven years happily in their company. However, while he was still in his youth, he was attacked by tuberculosis, and although everyone tried to effect a cure, the Kuru prince died, setting like the evening sun. Bhishma lamented the death of his younger brother, and finally performed the last funeral rites."
4,Adi Parv,Bhishma Battles Parashurama,"After receiving consent from Maharaja Bhishma, Princess Amba left the city of Hastinapura, and traveled to the province where King Salwa ruled. She was granted an interview and bowing before him she pleaded, ""I have come to take shelter of your mighty arms, O brave King. Please accept me as your queen.  King Salwa laughed to hear Amba's request and informed her, ""I no longer desire you for my queen, for you have been touched by another. It is Bhishma only who can marry you. When Bhishma abducted you, you followed him willingly enough. How can a king like myself, who is acquainted with Vedic knowledge and is supposed to guide others accordingly, accept into his palace a woman who is intended to marry another? O princess of Kashi, you may go wherever you like, but I cannot accept you as my queen.
Amba was aggrieved by King Salwa's rejection. She pleaded again, ""O lord of the earth, it is not as you say. Bhishma took me away by force. I did not go with him willingly. I am attached to you, and I beg you to accept me. The scriptures declare that a king should not abandon one who is dependent on him. I swear, O tiger among men, that I have never thought of any other man except you. Bhishma will not marry anyone, and my two sisters have been married to Vichitravirya. Therefore, O King, accept me as you wife for I have no other shelter.  Although she repeatedly solicited King Salwa, he would not accept her and ordered her to leave his kingdom. Thus Amba left the kingdom of Salwa, lamenting her destiny.
Amba decided to inhabit the forest and practice austerities and penances for the rest of her life. In her wanderings, she came upon the ashrama of some great rishis, and she informed them of her plight. It so happened that among those great sages was her maternal grandfather, Hotravahana. The royal sage felt despondent for what had befallen her and told her that on the following , Parashurama, the martial teacher of Bhishma, would come to the ashrama. He was sure Parashurama would influence Bhishma to accept her hand in marriage.
The next  Parashurama arrived at the ashrama and Amba related to him the events of her abduction by Bhishma and her rejection by King Salwa. She requested the great sage to kill Bhishma. Parashurama felt sorry for the girl and gave her hope by saying, ""O daughter of Kashi, I will not take up weapons except to protect those that follow the Vedas. Tell me, therefore, what I can do for you. Both Bhishma and Salwa are obedient to me. Do not lament. I will fulfill your desire.
Parashurama, the annihilator of the ksatriyas, then went to Hastinapura, and when Bhishma learned that his preceptor had arrived, he went out of the city to greet him. Bhishma worshipped him according to his position and then waited for him to speak. Rama inquired from Bhishma, ""After taking a vow of celibacy, in what mood did you abduct the princess of Kashi and then send her away? Contaminated by the touch of your hands, no one will marry her. Salwa has rejected her because you have forcibly placed her on your chariot. O King, it is not proper for her to be humiliated in this way. Therefore, at my command take her yourself and marry her according to Vedic rites.
""O brahmana,  Maharaja Bhishma replied, ""I could not bestow this maiden upon my brother because of her desire to accept Salwa as her lord. As for myself, I have taken a vow of perpetual celibacy, and I will not break that vow under any circumstances.  Upon hearing the disobedient words of his disciple, Parashurama was outraged and rolling his eyes in anger, he said, ""If you do not follow my commands, then I shall kill you this very , along with your counsellors!  Bhishma tried to placate his preceptor by sweet words, but Parashurama could not be pacified. He told Bhishma, ""You accepted me as your preceptor, yet, O Kaurava, you will not follow my instructions. If you want to please me then accept this maiden as your wife.
""I cannot follow this instruction, O best of the rishis,  Maharaja Bhishma replied. ""O son of Jamadagni, all your attempts to secure this marriage will be in vain. What warrior would accept into his abode a woman whose heart was wedded to another. O brahmana, I will not forsake justice even from fear of Indra. One can reject the order of the preceptor if he is filled with vanity, destitute of knowledge concerning right and wrong, and who follows a devious path. You are my preceptor, and I have tried to pacify you as far as possible. However, this instruction is not according to religious principles, and therefore, I will fight with you. I would never slay my preceptor in battle. However, it is a well known truth that one is not guilty of slaying a brahmana who takes up arms like a kshatriya. Because you are acting unrighteously, I will fight with you. O Rama, equip yourself with proper weapons and position yourself on the Kurukshetra field. Subdued by my arrows, you will obtain the higher regions. The brahmanas have spoken of the power which you exhibited against the kingly dynasties long ago. However, in those s there was no Bhishma, nor were there any warrior kings like Bhishma. Kshatriyas endowed with power took their births later on. The person who will quell your pride has now taken birth, and this is none other than myself.
Bhishma and Parashurama then made their way to Kurukshetra. Maharaja Bhishma was stationed on a chariot drawn by white horses. Parashurama had created by his mystic power a beautiful chariot drawn by horses that could travel at the speed of the mind. The fighting began when Parashurama struck his disciple with hundreds of arrows. Bhishma countered with many more arrows, and the fighting went on till the end of the . However, it was seen that neither was the victor.
After the battle had ceased, Bhishma's charioteer plucked out Parashurama's arrows from his own body. He also withdrew the arrows from the horses and those of his master, Bhishma. The son of Ganga then went to his tent for his nightly rest. When the sun had risen the following , the battle resumed. Bhishma offered his obeisances unto his preceptor and again fought with him. On this  all the celestial weapons were used. Rama released the vayavaya weapon (tornado weapon), but Bhishma countered it with the guhyaka weapon. Bhishma then released the agneya weapon which brought about great fire. However Parashurama released the varuna weapon (water weapon) causing the fire to abate. The preceptor neutralized all the weapons released by his disciple. Parashurama then released a flaming arrow that struck Bhishma in the chest, causing him to fall unconscious on the floor of his chariot. The charioteer then took Bhishma away from the battlefield. All the followers of Parashurama, including the princess of Kashi, were pleased with that action. However, Bhishma regained consciousness and came back to fight with his martial teacher. He struck Parashurama with a powerful arrow, causing him to fall unconscious on the battlefield. The princess of Kashi and others came to his side, reviving him with cold water and sweet words. Parashurama then rose up like lightning, and again engaged in furious combat with his disciple. In this way the duel went on for twenty three s.
On the night of the twenty third , Maharaja Bhishma retired to his tent and, lying down on his bed, began to reason, ""This fighting has been going on for many s, and still I have not defeated him. I am unable to vanquish the son of Jamadagni. If I am to succeed in subduing this foremost brahmana, then the gods must assist me.  Thinking like this, Bhishma fell asleep. In a dream, eight brahmanas appeared before him encouraging, ""Rise up, O son of Ganga. Do not fear. We will protect you from Parashurama. We will help you conquer Rama in battle. During tomorrows encounter, the mantras for the praswapa weapon will come to your mind. Neither Parashurama nor any other person is acquainted with it. With this weapon you will defeat your preceptor. O King, it will not slay Parashurama outright, and, therefore, there will be no sin incurred in using it. After he has been defeated, you will be able to awaken him with the samvodhana weapon.  Having said this much, the eight effulgent brahmanas disappeared.
When dawn appeared the next , Maharaja Bhishma joyfully equipped himself for battle. Parashurama also ascended his chariot and prepared to fight his disobedient disciple. Parashurama first hurled a dart that was as relentless as Indra's thunderbolt. It was thrown with such lightning force that it appeared like a blazing meteor. That dart descended upon the Bhishma's shoulder, causing severe pain to the great hero. Angered by the weapon, Bhishma released an arrow that struck his martial teacher in the forehead. Rama paid no attention to the pain and invoked the brahmastra weapon. This weapon is similar to a modern  atomic bomb. Bhishma also released the same weapon, and when the two weapons met, there was an expansion of light similar to that at the time of dissolution. When the two weapons were neutralized, Bhishma thought of releasing the praswapa weapon. When he was thinking in this way, the mantras for the weapon appeared in his mind. While Bhishma was fixing the weapon to his bowstring, he heard many voices in the sky loudly exclaiming, ""O son of the Kuru race, do not release the praswapa weapon!  Bhishma paid no attention and drew back the string of his bow. At that time Narada appeared on the scene imploring Bhishma, ""O descendent of Kuru, do not release this weapon. Even the demigods are forbidding you. Rama is a brahmana who has performed great austerities, and he is also your teacher. O Bhishma, never humiliate him.
Upon hearing Narada's order, Bhishma withdrew the praswapa weapon. Parashurama's father, Jamadagni and grandfather, Richika, then appeared before Parashurama ordering, ""O son, never again engage in battle with Bhishma or any other kshatriya. Heroism and courage in battle are the qualities of a warrior, and study of the Vedas and the practice of austerities are the wealth of the brahmanas. Previously you took up weapons to protect the brahmanas, but this is not the case now. Let this battle with Bhishma be your last.
Parashurama then replied to his forefathers, ""I cannot give up this combat. I have vowed that I will never leave the battlefield without defeating my enemy. This battle can only cease if Ganga's son desists from fighting.
Those great sages then went to Bhishma requesting, ""O son of Shantanu, you should not fight any longer with your preceptor. You should now worship that esteemed brahmana.
""I have taken a vow that I will never lay down my weapons without defeating my enemy,  Bhishma replied. ""I cannot abandon my kshatriya oath.
The sages once again spoke to Rama, ""O son of the Bhrigu race, it is not possible to defeat Bhishma, nor is it possible for Bhishma to defeat you. It has been ordained by providence that the son of Indra, Arjuna, will be the slayer of Bhishma.  While the forefathers of Rama were speaking to him, the pitris (a class of demigods) appeared on the scene and obstructed the chariot of Rama. They forbade him to fight any longer.
Just at this time, the eight effulgent brahmanas that Maharaja Bhishma had seen in his dream appeared before him requesting, ""O powerful warrior, go to your preceptor and worship him. Without his benediction, you cannot obtain happiness.
Bhishma, upon seeing that his mentor had laid aside his weapons, bowed before him and offered respectful worship. Rama then praised his disciple, ""There is no kshatriya equal to you on earth. You have pleased me with your prowess and your humility.  Bhishma then offered respects to his teacher and returned to Hastinapura.
Parashurama then called for Amba and remorsefully said to her, ""O princess of Kashi, I have fought to my best ability, but I could not defeat Bhishma. I have fought with the weapons of the heavenly gods, but still I could not slay him. O beautiful lady, fate seems to have you in her strong grip. It will not be possible for me to change what providence has destined for you.
Amba was determined that Bhishma should die. She again inhabited the forest and practiced very severe austerities. She gave up all food and water and lived only on air. She stood immovable like a tree for six months. After this she increased her austerities by entering the waters of the Yamuna for one whole year. She then stood on her toes for twelve years, scorching the heavens by her austerities. Soon Lord Shiva became pleased and appeared before her. He asked her to take a benediction. With joined palms, she solicited Bhishma's death. He granted the benediction saying, ""It will be you who will cause his death.  Amba then inquired, ""How will it come to pass that I, a woman, will defeat Bhishma?  Lord Shiva replied, ""My boons will never go in vain. You will be born in your next life as a female in the family of King Drupada, changing to manhood in that very life. You will become a great maharathi (chariot fighter), and remembering your former hatred for Bhishma and the incidents in this life, you will cause his death in battle.  After granting this benediction, Lord Shiva disappeared from that place.
Amba was joyous to receive Lord Shiva's boon. Wanting to take her next birth as soon as possible, she gathered logs for a funeral pyre. When the fire was blazing, she entered it uttering the words, ""I pray for Bhishma's death.  Amba then took her birth in the family of King Drupada, and she was known as Shikhandi. She was born to fulfill Lord Shiva's benediction."
5,Adi Parv,"The Birth of Dhritarastra, Pandu and Vidura","After the last funeral rites were performed for Vichitravirya, Satyavati wept and lamented for her deceased son. Ambika and Ambalika were also greatly overwhelmed at the untimely death of their husband. Upon realizing the possible extinction of the dynasty, Satyavati approached Bhishma requesting him, ""The perpetuation of the Kuru dynasty now depends on you. The wives of your brother, Ambalika and Ambika, desire progeny, and under my order you should procreate children by them to continue this dynasty. You should duly marry a wife of good character and enthrone yourself as king. Do not plunge our ancestors into hell.
Upon hearing Satyavati's request, the relatives and friends of the Kuru family agreed. However, Bhishma replied to his stepmother, ""O mother, what you have said is certainly sanctioned according to the code of virtue, but you forget my vow regarding marriage and children. I have taken a vow of lifelong celibacy. I may have to renounce kingship of the three worlds, the kingdom of heaven, and anything greater that exists, but this vow I will never renounce. The earth may lose its scent, water may lose its moisture, the sun may lose its glory, and fire, its heat. The moon may lose its cooling rays, or Indra his prowess, but I will not renounce this vow.
Hearing Bhishma's determination, Satyavati replied, ""I know the vow that you have taken is on my account, but considering the present emergency you should accept this order as duty to the ancestors.  Bhishma again emphasized his duty to truth, ""O Queen, do not sway from the path of virtue. Renunciation of a vow is never acclaimed in the shastras (holy scriptures). Listen to this narration and then decide the right course of action. In a former millennium, Parashurama, killed Kartavirya Arjuna in battle for the sin of slaying his father. Not only did he kill the followers of Kartavirya Arjuna, but he destroyed the entire kshatriya race twenty-one times. When the earth was devoid of great warriors, the queens approached the great rishis and procreated children by them and thus the kshatriya race was revived. Therefore, a purified brahmana should be invited with an offer of wealth, and let him raise children by the wives of Vicitravirya.
Smiling brightly, Satyavati agreed with Bhishma and informed him, ""O descendant of Bharata, I agree with this proposal. I now understand what is to be done in this connection. My father was an honest man, and to maintain pious activities, he kept a boat for rowing passengers across the river Yamuna. One  the great sage Parashara came and requested me to take him across the river. While I was rowing the boat, the sage became attracted to my beauty and requested fulfillment of his passionate desire. However, I was afraid of my father's wrath, but I was also afraid that the rishi might curse me. The sage brought me under his control, and in the middle of the river Yamuna, he created a dense fog. He satisfied his sensual desires and was very pleased with my submissiveness.
""Before that time,  Satyavati continued, ""a fishy odor emanated from my body, but after the rishi's touch, a celestial aroma radiates from my person. The sage assured me that by bringing forth a child in the middle of the river, I would still remain a virgin. The child born of our union was the eminent erudite sage, Vyasadeva. He has compiled the Vedic knowledge, and expounded the science of devotion to God. Because he was born in the middle of a river, he became known as Dwaipayana [the island born]. Because he compiled the Vedas, he is known as Vyasadeva, and because of his blackish complexion, he is known as Krishna. He is truthful in speech, sense controlled, and freed from all sins. If I ask him, then certainly he will generate good children by the wives of your brother. Previously, Vyasa had promised me, Mother, when you are in difficulty simply remember me, and I will come to you by the speed of the mind.' If you are willing, Bhishma, I will call him this very moment.
Upon hearing the name of Vyasa, Bhishma joined his palms in reverence saying, ""This sage has true wisdom and sense control, and would be a fit person to continue the Kuru dynasty. Therefore, you have my full approval.""
When Bhishma had given his consent, Satyavati immediately thought of her son, Vyasa, and within moments, the great sage appeared before her. Satyavati duly welcomed her son and taking him in her arms, bathed him with affectionate tears. Vyasa offered obeisances to his mother saying, ""O mother, I have come to fulfill your desire. Command me at once, and I shall carry out your order.
""O my son,  Satyavati replied, ""recently Vichitravirya, the King of this world, expired leaving no descendant, and thus the Kuru dynasty is in danger of extinction. Here is Bhishma, Shantanu's son, but he has taken a vow of celibacy and will not beget children. The two wives of Vichitravirya, Ambika and Ambalika, are still living, and I request you to conceive children by them to continue the Kuru dynasty.
Vyasadeva, hearing the appeals of his mother, replied, ""Since Vichitravirya is my brother, born of your womb, I shall give birth to children who will equal the heavenly gods. Let the queens observe the vows I indicate for one full year.
Satyavati expressed her urgency, ""There is very little time for vows. The earth is without a king, and the citizens, being without a protector, will certainly perish.
""If conception must take place this month,  Vyasadeva replied, ""then the queens of Kashi must be willing to bear my ugliness, strong odor and matted locks. If they can perform these austerities, then they will give birth to noble children. Let one of the queens, dressed in clean clothes and bedecked with ornaments, wait for me in her bed chamber.
Satyavati then approached Ambika, explaining to her the situation. With great e fort Ambika was convinced that it was for the good of the world. When the right time came for conceiving a child, Satyavati took Ambika to the bed chamber and told her, ""Vichitravirya had an older brother who has been, until this time, unknown to you. He will soon come here and conceive a child by you that will perpetuate our dynasty. Wait for him here without dropping off to sleep.
Ambika then waited in her room contemplating the person to be Bhishma or one of the other Kuru elders. Suddenly Vyasadeva entered the room, and Ambika, seeing his matted locks, ugly features and grim visage, closed her eyes in fear and did not open them once during the time of conception. When Vyasa came out of the chambers, he met his mother who inquired, ""Will this princess have a worthy son?  Hearing her, he replied, ""The child born shall have the power of ten thousand elephants. He will be equal to a royal sage, and will possess learning, intelligence and prowess. However, because the princess has closed her eyes during conception, the child shall be born blind.  Upon hearing this prediction from her son, Satyavati wondered, ""How can a blind king rule this earth? How will he protect his family and the people of this world? You must again conceive another child that can act as a King.  Vyasadeva agreed and went away. In due course of time, Ambika gave birth to a male child who was blind. After the child's birth, he was given the name Dhritarastra.
Satyavati was anxious to beget another male child who could rule the world, and after receiving Ambalika's consent, she called for Vyasadeva. Vyasadeva came as promised and approached the chambers of Ambalika. Ambalika, seeing the repulsive features of Vyasa, turned pale with fear. After conception, the sage left the chambers and told his mother, ""Because this queen has paled upon seeing my austere features, the child born will be white in color. His name, therefore, will be Pandu, or one with a white complexion.  In due course of time, Ambalika gave birth to a child endowed with auspicious marks. He was pale in complexion, but was handsome in all respects. Indeed, it was this child who would become the future father of the Pandavas.
Sometime after this child was born, Satyavati approached the beautiful Ambalika, again asking her to conceive a child by Vyasadeva. The princess felt she could not bear again to see the ugly features of the sage, and thus she sent to her chambers one of her maid servants who had heavenly beauty. When Vyasa entered the chambers, the maid servant offered respects to the sage, treating him kindly. She took her seat near him when asked. Vyasadeva was well pleased with her, and upon leaving told her, ""You shall be a slave no longer. Your child will be justice personified and esteemed among intelligent men on earth.
After leaving the queen's chambers, Vyasa met his mother and informed her of Ambalika's deception, and how he had begotten a son by a shudra woman. After speaking with his mother, Vyasa disappeared. The child born of the maid servant was named Vidura. He was an incarnation of Yamaraja, the great vaishnava mahajana and the lord of death. Due to the curse of Mandavya Muni, Yamaraja had to be born on earth as a shudra. Thus from the wives of Vichitravirya, Vyasadeva begot two sons, Dhritarastra and Pandu, who would save the Kuru race from extinction."
6,Adi Parv,The Pandavas are Born,"Upon the birth of Dhritarastra, Pandu, and Vidura, the earth prospered. There was an abundant harvest of crops, and all the trees were ladened with fruits and flowers. The seasons arrived and passed on time, and there was ample rainfall in the land of Bharatvarsha. The people became learned, brave and honest, and guided by Maharaja Bhishma, performed devotional sacrifices for the pleasure of Lord Vishnu. The people of Hastinapura were so contented with the rule of Maharaja Bhishma that they thought they were living in the Vaikuntha planets. Hearing of the Kuru's prosperity, people came to take shelter in that kingdom. Thus under the influence of a godly King the earth prospered.
Maharaja Bhishma raised the three children, Dhritarastra, Pandu and Vidura, as if they were his own. As Pandu grew, he excelled all men in archery, whereas Dhritarastra excelled in personal strength, and it was soon known to everyone that there was no one equal to Vidura in devotion to Vishnu and knowledge of the dictates of morality. In due course of time Pandu became King, for Dhritarastra was blind, and Vidura was born of a maid servant. Therefore, neither of them could accept the throne.
As Dhritarastra and Pandu matured in age, the time came to marry them to proper wives. Considering the situation, Bhishma decided that three princesses were worthy of being married to the Kuru princes. They were Gandhari, the daughter of the Gandhara King, Pritha, the daughter of King Surasena, and Madri, the daughter of the King of Madras. Bhishma had heard that Gandhari, the daughter of King Subala, was granted a benediction by Lord Shiva that she could have one hundred sons. Attracted to the idea of marrying Dhritarastra to Gandhari, Bhishma, the grandfather of the Kurus, sent messengers to the father of Gandhari. King Subala at first hesitated, hearing that Dhritarastra was blind, but taking into consideration the blood line of the Kurus, he consented to marry her to Dhritarastra. When the chaste Gandhari heard that her future husband was blind, she voluntarily blindfolded herself and took a vow to remain so for the rest of her life. Shakuni, the son of Subala, then took Gandhari to the city of the Kurus, Hastinapura, and formally handed her over to Dhritarastra. Gandhari became so chaste and devoted to Dhritarastra, that she never spoke of men other than her husband or her superiors.
The chief of the Yadu dynasty was Surasena. He was the father of the magnanimous Vasudeva. He also had a daughter named Pritha, who was unrivaled in beauty among earth women. She was adopted by King Kuntibhoja, who had no children. This was an agreement made previously by the two Kings. They agreed that if a girl was born to Surasena, she would be handed over to King Kuntibhoja who was childless. Thus Pritha, who later became known as Kunti, lived in the palace of King Kuntibhoja and looked after the duties of greeting important guests and brahmanas. Once, during her youthful years, she pleased, by menial service, the easily angered brahmana Durvasa Muni. The muni gave her a benediction that she could call any celestial being from the heavenly regions to produce children of the highest quality. Kunti, while still a virgin girl, once called, out of curiosity, Surya, the sun god. When she chanted the mantra, the sun god immediately appeared before her saying, ""I have come before you, O lotus-eyed lady. Please fulfill the purpose of the mantra.  Kunti was stunned and told the sun god, ""I simply tested the mantra given to me by Durvasa Muni. O lord, please forgive my offense.  Surya replied, ""Once I have been called by this mantra, the result cannot go in vain; it must bear fruit. Although you will bear a son by me, you shall remain a virgin girl.
Thus succumbing to the desires of the deva, Kunti immediately conceived and bore a child that was equal to the sun god himself. The child was born with natural golden armor and glittering earrings. To keep her virginity intact, the sun god arranged that the child be born from Kunti's ear, and for this reason the child was named Karna. The sun god immediately ascended to heaven. Not knowing what to do, Kunti placed the child in a basket and set it afloat on the Ganges. She prayed to the sun god to protect the child. The child floated down the river for some time and was eventually picked up by a carpenter and chariot driver named Adiratha. In great happiness he took the newly found child to his wife Radha, who was childless. Together, both mother and father began to care for the child considering him a gift of providence. Unfortunately, Kunti had to give the child up out of fear of her relatives.
When it was time for Kunti to be married, her foster father, Kuntibhoja, invited princes and kings from other countries to be present. In this svayamvara (wedding) ceremony she was to pick her own husband. The budding youthful Kunti, upon entering the assembly hall, saw the handsome Pandu, proud as a lion, broad-chested and endowed with unsurpassable prowess. He was like the moon amidst its many luminaries. Advancing with modesty, she placed the wedding garland around Pandu's neck, and thus she accepted the Kuru prince as her beloved husband. King Kuntibhoja arranged for the wedding functions and bestowed upon Pandu a large dowry. Afterwards, Pandu took his new wife back to Hastinapura and gave her the opulence she deserved.
Sometime later, Bhishma set his heart upon getting Pandu married to a second wife. Accompanied by his army, Bhishma went to the kingdom of Madras. There he obtained Madri, the attractive sister of Salya, and, after receiving a sufficient dowry, brought her back to Hastinapura where she was united to Pandu in great pomp.
After some time, Pandu set his mind on conquering the world. With his vast army, consisting of many akshauhini divisions of soldiers, Pandu subjugated one country after another (A solid phalanx of 21,870 chariots, 21,870 elephants, 109,650 infantry and 65,000 calvary is called an akshauhini). He first conquered the robber tribes of Asarna. He next headed toward the kingdom of Magadha, where there reigned a King named Dhirga. This King was proud of his strength and had made numerous offenses against other monarches. Pandu broke the strength of his army and killed him on the field of battle. Taking everything in the King's treasury, he marched into Mithila and subjugated the Videhas. He then conquered the kingdoms of Kashi, Sumbha, and Pundra. When all the kings of the world were thus defeated, they considered Pandu to be a demigod like Indra, the King of heaven. They paid tribute to him and offered all kinds of wealth to gain his favor. Thus the Kuru King returned to his capital, taking with him his acquired opulence.
After establishing his power over the earth, King Pandu retired to the forest along with his two wives, Kunti and Madri. There they lived in opulence and enjoyed the beautiful wooded areas at the base of the Himalayan mountains. One , Pandu, while roaming about the forest, saw a large deer that seemed to be the leader of a herd. It was engaged in sex with its female companion. Pandu pierced them both with five sharp arrows. The animal was not actually a deer but a rishi's son of great ascetic merit, who was enjoying his mate in the form of a deer. When pierced in this way, the deer fell uttering cries like a human being.
In anger the deer chastised Maharaja Pandu, ""O King, even men that are slaves to lust and anger and who are ever sinful never commit cruel acts such as this. Why have you pierced me with arrows while I was enjoying my wife?
""Kings engage in the sport of killing deer in the same way as they kill opponents of religion,  Pandu replied. ""You should not reproach me for a sin done in ignorance. Animals of this species are killed in the open or hidden from view. Formerly, the sage Agastya, while engaged in the performance of sacrifice, killed every deer in the forest and offered it in sacrifice to the heavenly gods. I am presently killing deer in the forest for use in sacrifice. You have been killed for the same reason. Seeing that I am following in the footsteps of the great sages, why do you reproach me?
""O King,  the deer replied, ""I do not blame you for slaying a deer. But instead of acting so cruelly, you should have waited till the act of intercourse was complete. I am a muni named Kindama, and I was engaged in sexual intercourse with my mate, because unrestricted sex life is not allowed in human society. You have slain me without knowing that I am a brahmana, and therefore, the reaction for killing a brahmana will not come upon you. However, because you have killed me while I was enjoying my wife, certainly your fate will be like mine. When you approach your wife for intercourse, premature death will overcome you and your wife. You have brought lamentation to me when I was seeking happiness, and now I say, grief will come to you when you seek pleasure with your wife.  Pronouncing this curse, the sage, in the form of a deer, left his body and attained the heavenly regions due to his ascetic merits.
After the sage's death, King Pandu was momentarily bewildered by such a reversal in his life. ""The wicked,  Pandu exclaimed, ""even if born in pious families, are deluded by their passions. Although I am the son of the great Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa, I have engaged in the frivolous act of killing deer in the forest. O, how foolish I have been; the demigods have forsaken me. I now seek liberation. The great impediments to salvation are the desire to beget children and the other pleasures related to sex life. I shall live the life of an ascetic and bring my passions under control by severe austerities. I shall renounce my kingdom and, shaving my head, wander the earth begging my sustenance from the trees and the rivers. I will no longer find fault with others, but have a friendly attitude, devoted to the good of all creatures. I will take complete shelter of the Supreme Lord, who is the only savior from all miseries.
After this unforeseen calamity, King Pandu sent all his servants and wealth back to Hastinapura, and he also sent the news to Bhishma and his brothers of all that had taken place. The elders in the court at Hastinapura were sullen on hearing what had happened. Dhritarastra was especially affected by the turn of events.
While living in the forest, Pandu renounced sense gratification and became a distinguished sage, although born of the warrior race. The great rishis in the forest treated him like a brother or friend. While living in the forest, Pandu became fully satisfied in himself, but he understood that the world was now without protection. Also he knew that his debt to his forefathers could not be paid unless he had children who could perform sacrifices. When the rishis in the forest visited the heavenly realm, Pandu could not accompany them. With some anxiety in his heart, he requested Kunti, ""For the world's protection and to preserve the Bharata dynasty, I want you to procreate children by a highly advanced brahmana. Without powerful children to maintain the Kuru dynasty, the whole world may fall into ruin. Also, one has a debt to pay to his ancestors by begetting good children. In the same manner that Vyasadeva conceived me, I want you to concieve children by the semen of some great rishi.
Kunti was ever agreeable to her husband's desires and advised him, ""When I was a young girl, I used to wait upon guests and satisfy them to their hearts' content. One  a brahmana named Durvasa Muni came to my father's palace. By my menial services I satisfied the brahmana, and he desired to grant me a benediction. He bestowed upon me a mantra by which I could call any demigod from the heavenly realms. He benedicted me saying, With this mantra you may call any demigod, and they will abide by your will. Any demigod you summon will give you children.' On your order, I shall petition any celestial being you wish. O foremost of all truthful men, tell me which of the devas I should summon.
Kunti's words delighted Pandu, and he joyfully replied, ""O most fortunate Kunti, invite the ruler of justice, Yamaraja. He is most pious and devoted to Lord Vishnu. Indeed, he is a mahajanas and will not pollute our dynasty with sin.  Kunti abided by Pandu's order and prepared to call the demigod Yamaraja. (At this time Gandhari had been pregnant for one whole year.) Kunti repeated the incantation that Durvasa Muni had imparted to her, and Yamaraja appeared. By him she conceived a child that was equal to the great Yamaraja himself. When the child was born, there was a celestial voice from the heavens that announced, ""This child will possess divine consciousness, and he will be the foremost of virtuous. He will become famous as one who rules by the will of God. Endowed with invincibility and truthful speech, he will become the emperor of this earth. This first son of Pandu will be named Yudhisthira, and his fame shall be celebrated throughout the heavens.
Pandu was overjoyed by the birth of such a pious son, and he again ordered Kunti, ""The wise have declared that a king must be endowed with physical strength, otherwise he is no warrior. Therefore, call for Vayu, the mighty demigod of the wind.  Kunti then summoned the celestial being Vayu, and coming before her, the wind god inquired, ""O Kunti, please tell me why you have called me.  Smiling with modesty, she replied, ""Please give me, O best of the celestials, a child endowed with super human strength and a robust body. Let him be capable of humbling the pride of everyone.  Vayu then conceived a child by her who was destined to become the strongest human on earth. When the child was born, a voice from the heavens announced, ""This child shall be known as Bhima, and by his physical prowess he will conquer all men.  On this same  that Bhima took his birth, Duryodhana was also born from Gandhari.
One , shortly after Bhima's birth, Kunti was holding him in her lap. The child had just fallen asleep, when suddenly a lion roared. Kunti rose, forgetful that the child was on her lap. The child fell down the mountain side and pulverized a large stone upon which he fell. The child was not hurt in the least, but Pandu was amazed at the sturdy body of his son.
After the birth of Bhima, Pandu desired more children. He told Kunti to practice austerities for one year, and he himself stood on one leg from morning till evening every  in rapt meditation, hoping to satisfy Indra, the King of heaven. Indra, being pleased with Pandu, appeared before him and said, ""I will give you, O King, a child who will be celebrated for all time. He shall annihilate the impious and give joy to the virtuous. He will be a great devotee of the one Supreme Lord.
King Pandu then called for Kunti, and told her to summon Indra. Kunti, following the order of her husband, called Indra, and by him a child was born that was to be the intimate friend of Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Upon the birth of this child, a celestial voice from the heavens announced, ""This child shall be known as Arjuna. He will be equal in bowmanship to the great Kartavirya, and in prowess he will resemble Lord Shiva. Invincible in battle, he will propagate the fame of the Kuru dynasty far and wide. After acquiring all celestial weapons, he will retrieve the fortunes of your dynasty.  After these prophetic words were heard, kettledrums rolled, and the heavenly gods and rishis showered flowers on the Earth.
The celebrated Pandu was overjoyed and approached his wife aspiring for more children. However, before Pandu could speak, Kunti warned, ""The wise do not sanction a fourth child even in case of emergency. The woman who has intercourse with four different men is called a prostitute, and with a fifth she is called a harlot. Therefore, O great King, because you are learned in the scriptures, please do not ask me again to bear children.
After the birth of Kunti's first three sons and also the birth of one hundred sons to Gandhari, Madri, the daughter of the Madras King, approached Pandu requesting, ""O great King, I have no objection if you do not favor me. O sinless one, I also have no complaint that although I am senior to Kunti, I am inferior to her in position. I do not grieve when I hear that Gandhari has obtained 100 sons. This, however, is my great grief that while Kunti and I are equal, I am childless. If Kunti could teach me to have children in the same way that she has conceived these children, then I would be satisfied. Please ask her on my account.
Pandu then lovingly requested Kunti to teach the mantra to Madri so that she could also have children. Kunti readily agreed, and told Madri, ""Think of some demigod you favor and certainly by him you shall bear children.  Madri thought of the twin Asvini-kumara demigods, and within a matter of seconds, they appeared before her. They gave her two children named Nakula and Sahadeva, who were unrivaled on earth for personal beauty. As soon as they were born, a voice from the heavens proclaimed, ""In prowess and beauty these two children shall excel even the twin Asvins themselves.  Thus five children were born to Pandu, and the great King felt fully satisfied to see the good quality of his children. As they grew, they were favored by the great sages in that region.
Gandhari also gave birth to children. She received a benediction from Vyasadeva that she could have one hundred sons. Sometime thereafter, Gandhari conceived, and she bore the pregnancy for two years without delivering. When she heard that Kunti had given birth to a child whose splendor was like the morning sun, she was angered and violently hit her womb. She then gave birth to a piece of flesh that was hard like an iron ball. When she was about to throw the ball of flesh away, Vyasadeva appeared. Without disguising her feelings, she angrily cried, ""When I heard that Kunti gave birth to a child who was radiant like the sun, I struck my womb. You have promised me a hundred sons, but here is a ball of flesh.
""O daughter of Subala,  Vyasadeva replied, ""my boons will always bear fruit. I have never falsified a benediction even in jest. You should now arrange that a hundred pots full of clarified butter be brought instantly. In the meantime sprinkle cool water over this piece of flesh.
Gandhari was pacified and began sprinkling water on the ball of flesh. It separated into 100 pieces, each about the size of a thumb. Each piece of flesh was then placed in a pot of ghee and covered. Vyasadeva told Gandhari that a child would be born from each of the pots. He then left for the Himalayan Mountains.
The first child born from one of the hundred pots was Duryodhana. As soon as he could cry, he began to bray like an ass. And hearing that sound, the asses, vultures, jackals and crows uttered their respective cries. Violent winds began to blow, and there were fires in various directions. Duryodhana was born on the same  that Bhima was born.
After the birth of Duryodhana, Dhritarastra called for Bhishma, Vidura and all the senior brahmanas and members of the Kuru household. He questioned them, ""The oldest of the princes is Yudhisthira, and he shall become King. By virtue of his being the first born, he has gained the kingdom. But what about this son born to me. Will he become king?  While inquiring from the elders, jackals, crows and asses began to howl frightfully.
""O King,  Vidura said, ""when these frightful omens are noticeable at birth, it is evident that this child will destroy your dynasty. Your prosperity depends on forsaking him, and if you decide otherwise, misfortune will befall the Kurus. You already have 99 other sons, so let this one go. O King, favor the world by casting away this child.
When Vidura had wisely spoken, all the brahmanas agreed, but Dhritarastra had no heart to destroy a small baby. Within a month's time all the one hundred pots of ghee had produced a child, and in addition to these one hundred, Vyasadeva produced another pot in which a female child named Duhsala was born. There was also a vaishya woman who used to serve Dhritarastra very faithfully. By her the King conceived a child named Yuyutsu who later became renowned for sharp intelligence. Thus one hundred and one sons as well as one daughter were born to Dhritarastra. In order of birth, they were Duryodhana, Yuyutsu, Duhshasana, Duhshaha, Duhshala, etc. All the hundred and one sons became heroes and great chariot fighters.
One  after the birth of his five sons, King Pandu was wandering about the woods with his wife Madri. It was springtime and the forest flowers were in bloom, casting their scent in all directions. Birds like the parrot, the cuckoo, the crane, and the peacock were singing sweetly, and the bees were humming. Bewildered by the atmosphere, Pandu became attracted to his wife, and forgetting the curse of the rishi, forcibly embraced her. Madri tried to resist the advances of her husband, but it was no use. Impelled by fate, the great King, overwhelmed by passion, ended his life, trying to enjoy his beautiful wife.
Embracing the dead body of her husband and weeping aloud, Madri called out for Kunti. Kunti heard her cries and came to where Madri lay with Pandu. Viewing the dead body of Pandu, Kunti fell to the ground lamenting. She was overpowered by separation, and she chastised Madri repeatedly for not resisting the King. Madri related to her all that happened and how she tried to stop Pandu's advances. Kunti then decided, ""I am the eldest wife, and therefore the religious rite of Sati belongs to me. You must now take care of the children and see that they are raised properly.
""Kunti, it is I who should enter fire with our lord,  Madri replied. ""He approached me for enjoyment, and his desires being unfulfilled, ascended to the heavens. Therefore, I shall accompany him to Yamaraja's abode to satisfy him. If I survive, I shall certainly not be able to raise your children as if they were my own. But you, O Kunti, shall be able to raise my sons as if they were your own. Therefore, let my body be burnt with his.  Kunti reluctantly agreed to the proposal. With tearful eyes and sorrowful hearts, they built a funeral pyre and laid the dead body of Pandu upon it. As the body burned, Madri entered the flames and attained the same destination as her husband."
7,Adi Parv,The Poisoned Cake,"After King Pandu's demise, the sages in the forest assembled and discussed the future of Kunti and her sons. The rishis decided that the Pandavas, along with their mother, should live in Hastinapura and take shelter of Grandfather Bhishma and the Kuru elders. The sages had great compassion upon the people of the world. They were not just interested in their own salvation, but in the protection and advancement of the people in general. Knowing these boys to be future Kings of the earth, the great sages made arrangements for them to be placed under proper guidance.
Accompanied by the sages and the Charanas [a species of celestial beings like the seraphim and cherubim], Kunti and her children appeared outside the city gates of Hastinapura. Upon hearing that Kunti was at the city gate, the members of the Kuru court, headed by Bhishma, Dhritarastra and Vidura, came forward to welcome them. The citizens of Hastinapura also came there to see the sons of Pandu. Everyone was wonder struck to behold the godlike sages accompanied by the celestial Charanas.
The sages then informed the Kuru elders, ""As you well know the former king of this world, Pandu, had been living in the forest as an ascetic due to a muni's curse. The curse has now taken its toll and that great King has ascended to the heavenly planets. Here are his five children. The oldest is Yudhisthira, conceived by the controller of religion, Yamaraja himself. He is the future king. The second son, Bhima, conceived by the demigod Vayu, possesses infinite strength. The third son is Arjuna, conceived by the noble Indra himself. He will humble the pride of all archers on earth. The last two children are Nakula and Sahadeva, begotten by the Asvini-kumara demigods through Madri. The birth, growth and development of Pandu's children will give great pleasure to all. King Pandu and his wife Madri departed seventeen s ago. The last funeral rites need to be performed with honor befitting a king of this earth.  After informing the Kuru elders of all matters, the sages and Charanas disappeared from sight.
Dhritarastra then requested Vidura, ""O brother, we must perform the last rites for this King of kings and arrange charity to be given freely to whomever is in need.  The ashes of Pandu and Madri were then taken in state to the banks of the Ganges, where the last funeral rites were performed. The ashes were then cast into the Ganges. All the citizens, young and old, wept over the loss of their King, and thus passed twelve s in mourning.
One  after the shraddha ceremony (offering of Vishnu prasad to the forefathers) had been performed, Vyasadeva approached Satyavati and warned her, ""Mother, the s of happiness in the Kuru house will set like the evening sun. The empire of the Kauravas will no longer endure. You should not be a witness to the annihilation of your dynasty. Therefore, enter the forest and fix your mind on the Supreme Lord Vishnu, the protector of all.  Following the advice of Vyasa, Satyavati, along with Ambika and Ambalika, entered the forest. When their meditation attained perfection, they entered the spiritual world, Vaikuntha.
After the Pandavas settled in their father's palace, they accustomed themselves to the opulence that was due to them. Whenever Bhima was engaged in play with the sons of Dhritarastra, his strength became apparent. Bhima proved superior in speed, striking objects, consuming food and scattering dust. The son of the wind-god pulled the sons of Dhritarastra by the hair and made them fight with one another, laughing all the while. Bhima would seize them by the hair, throw them down, and drag them along the ground. In his playful mood, Bhima would accidentally break their knees, their heads and their shoulders.  while swimming together, the second son of Pandu would hold ten of them at a time under water until they were almost dead. When the sons of Dhritarastra would climb a tree to gather fruits, Bhima would shake the tree until the fruits as well as the one-hundred sons fell to the ground. He would play with them in childishness, but would never hurt them out of envy.
When it was obvious that Bhima could challenge all the one-hundred sons of Dhritarastra single-handedly, Duryodhana began to make deceitful plans to harm him. He thought, ""There is no person who can compare with Bhima's strength. He does not think twice of challenging my one-hundred brothers to combat. I will exterminate him and confine Yudhisthira and Arjuna to imprisonment. Then I shall be the sole heir to the throne without hindrance.
Possessed with this mentality, the wicked Duryodhana built a palace on the banks of the Ganges that was just for sporting in the water. His plan was to invite the Pandavas to this house and feed Bhima a poisoned cake. When Bhima was unconscious from the poison, Duryodhana and his brothers would throw him in the Ganges. With this evil plan in mind, Duryodhana began construction. After the palace was completed, Duryodhana invited his cousins, ""Let us go to Gange's bank and sport in the water. We shall have a picnic and enjoy the scenery.
Not understanding Duryodhana's evil intentions, the Pandavas accompanied Dhritarastra's sons to the banks of the Ganges and inspected the newly constructed palace by the water. They all sat down to a feast before swimming. Duryodhana brought Bhima a cake filled with enough poison to kill one hundred men. That wicked youth, who spoke sweetly, but whose heart was like a razor, continued to feed Bhima different kinds of food that were filled with poison. After the feast the boys began playing in the water. Bhima became fatigued from the poison, and rising from the water, lay down on the ground. Seizing this opportunity, Duryodhana and some of his brothers bound him with ropes and threw him into the Ganges. He sank down to the bottom of the river where the Naga (snake) kingdom is situated. Thousands of Nagas began to bite him, and the poison from the cake was neutralized by the serpents' venom.
On regaining consciousness, the son of Kunti broke his bonds and began killing the snakes that were biting him. The rest of the snakes fled and went to their leader Vasuki, telling him the events that had taken place. Vasuki happened to be related to Bhima through the wind god Vayu, and upon hearing that Bhima was present, he went to the spot and embraced him. Bhima then related to Vasuki the sinister plan of the poisoned cake. Vasuki, wanting to protect him from future attacks, offered Vayu's son eight bowls of nectar which empowered a person with the strength of ten thousand elephants. Bhima drank one bowl in one breath, and after drinking all eight, he lay down on a bed prepared by the serpents.
After Yudhisthira, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva and Dhritarastra's sons were satiated in their swimming play, they set out for Hastinapura anticipating that Bhima had already gone there. The wicked Duryodhana was elated thinking that Bhima was dead, and he appeared very happy on the way back to Hastinapura. Yudhisthira, who was unacquainted with vice and wickedness, thought nothing of the matter. Upon entering the palace chambers of his mother, he inquired, ""O mother, have you seen Bhima? I cannot find him anywhere. While swimming in the Ganges, he became tired and slept on the shore. After finishing our water sports, he had disappeared. Has he come here early because of exhaustion from swimming?
Kunti became alarmed when she heard that Bhima was missing. ""My dear Yudhisthira,  she said, ""I have not seen Bhima. He has not come here. Return in haste with your brothers and try to find him.  After dismissing her sons, Kunti summoned Vidura and anxiously spoke to him, ""O illustrious Vidura, Bhima is missing. To the boys went swimming in the Ganges, and they returned without him. I know that Duryodhana is envious of him. This first son of Dhritarastra is crooked, malicious, low-minded and cruel. His only desire is to obtain the throne. I am afraid he might have killed Bhima and this is saddening my heart.
""Blessed lady,  Vidura replied, ""do not grieve. Protect your sons with care. If Duryodhana is accused, he might slay the other sons. The great sage Vyasadeva has foretold that your sons will be long-lived. Therefore, Bhima will surely return and gladden your heart.  Vidura then left for his residence and Kunti, unable to shake her anxiety, stayed in her quarters.
Meanwhile, Bhimasena awoke from his deep sleep after eight s. The Nagas extoled him and tended to his needs. ""O greatly powerful Bhima,  they said, ""you are filled with the nectar of the heavenly gods. This will give you the vitality of ten thousand elephants. No one will be able to defeat you in battle. You must now return home, for your mother is in deep anxiety over your absence.  The Nagas then dressed him in fine silks and ornaments and returned him to the palace by the river.
Bhima sprinted to Hastinapura with great haste. He entered the palace of his mother and bowed at her feet and at the feet of his elder brother. Queen Kunti took her son on her lap, and as she affectionately embraced him, tears glided down her face. The other brothers gathered round and welcomed him warmly. Bhima then briefed them on everything that had happened. He explained how Duryodhana had tried to poison him, and how the wicked son of Dhritarastra and his brothers had tied him up and thrown him in the Ganges. Bhima also explained how the Nagas had bitten him, countering the poison in the cake. He told how he had been given eight bowls of immortal elixir, and how his strength had increased thousands of times. ""Do not speak of this to anyone,  Yudhisthira said. ""From this  on we should protect one another with care. Under Vidura's guidance, no harm can come to us."
8,Adi Parv,The Preceptor Drona,"Seeing the princes enter adolescence, Maharaja Bhishma began searching for a suitable teacher to tutor them in the science of warfare. One  the heroic princes came out of Hastinapura. to play ball, and they roamed the forest areas absorbed in the ecstasy of young boys. When the ball fell into a well, they all tried their best to retrieve it, but found it impossible.
As they were looking in the well, a brahmana appeared who had just finished his daily performance of agnihotra (fire sacrifice). Seeing the princes unsuccessful in retrieving the ball, the brahmana, whose name was Dronacharya, approached them. He was dressed in white robes and looked thin and effulgent due to his performance of austerity and sacrifice. ""Shame on your kshatriya strength!  Drona chided the boys, ""You are born in the dynasty of Bharata and you cannot recover this ball from the well? Witness the power of my weapons!
Drona slipped off his ring and dropped it into the dry well. The ring landed on the ball. Taking a handful of grass, he chanted some Vedic mantras, turning the blades of grass into arrows. He then pierced the ring and the ball simultaneously. Piercing one arrow after another, he made a chain of arrows that came up to the top of the well. He then pulled the ball out of the well as the boys stood watching, struck with wonder. The boys offered their obeisances to the brahmana and inquired from him, ""O great brahmana, no one possesses such skill. Please reveal your identity and how we may render service to you.
""Go to Bhishma,  the brahmana replied, ""and describe my likeness and what you have just seen. He will tell you who I am.  The boys ran to Bhishma and explained to him everything that had happened. Bhishma smiled and exclaimed, ""This is Drona!  He then went out of the city to receive the elevated brahmana. Maharaja Bhishma brought him into the palace, and in private inquired from him, ""Dear brahmana, please let us know the reason for your arrival in Hastinapura.
""In my younger years,  Drona replied, ""I lived in the ashrama of my teacher along with the Panchala prince, Drupada. We made a close friendship, and were always looking after each other. He always told me that he was the favorite of his father, and that one  he would inherit the kingdom. Because we were close friends, he promised me that some  half his kingdom would be mine. After he finished his studies, he left for his own country.
""In time,  Drona continued, ""I married Krpi, the daughter of the sage Gautama, and begot a son named Ashvatthama. Because of poverty I could not even feed my son milk, and therefore, I went to the kingdom of the Panchalas to see my old friend, Drupada. When I entered the royal court, I greeted him joyfully, O tiger among men, It is Drona, your old friend.' Drupada was angered and derided me saying, You are certainly senseless, because you, a poor brahmana, are addressing me as your friend. My former friendship with you was for a particular reason. One of impure birth can never be a friend to one who is born of a high caste. Friendships can only exist between persons of equal rank. There cannot be friendship between the rich and the poor, or between a coward and a hero. O simpleton, great kings can never have friendships with poor and luckless fellows. I do not remember ever promising half my kingdom. I will, however, give you food and shelter for one night.' Unable to tolerate his abusive words, I quickly left his kingdom with a vow to win half his possessions. I have now desire to train competent students who can conquer the pride of this vain King. I have received all the celestial weapons from Parashurama, the annihilator of the kshatriyas. Because I am a brahmana, he taught me the complete science of warfare.
After Dronacharya had detailed his purpose, Maharaja Bhishma humbly implored him, ""String your bow, O great brahmana, and take the sons of Pandu and Dhritarastra as your disciples.  When Drona had been appointed the martial preceptor of his brother's children, Maharaja Bhishma gave him a suitable home that was furnished with all opulences.
After Drona had been properly situated, he soon began to train the young princes. Drona taught the sons of Pandu and the sons of Dhritarastra the use of many weapons, both human and celestial. Although the instruction given to them was the same, still Arjuna, the third son of Pandu, excelled all students. His lightness of hand and skill were beyond compare. Arjuna became very faithful to Drona and always stayed by his side. One , Drona gave to each of his students a narrow mouthed vessel to fill with water. However, he gave to his own son, Ashvatthama, a wide mouthed vessel so by filling it quickly, he could return to his father and receive special instructions. Arjuna came to know of this, and filling his vessel by means of the varuna astra (a celestial mantra that could produce water on the battlefield), he would come to the preceptor at the same time as Ashvatthama. Arjuna's allegiance and his strong appetite to learn won the heart of Drona. It soon became evident to everyone that Arjuna was the preceptor's favorite student.
One  Dronacharya told his cook, ""Never serve Arjuna food in the dark, nor tell him that I have given this order.  However, one night Arjuna was taking food in his tent by candlelight and suddenly a turbulent wind rose blowing out the candle. Arjuna continued to eat, although it was dark, and while he was eating, he thought, ""If I can eat in the dark, why can't I practice archery in the dark?  Thus he began training at night, and hearing the twang of Arjuna's bow, Drona came to him and embraced him lovingly, ""You are my foremost student, and I give you the benediction that there will not be an archer your equal in the world.
Thereafter, Drona began to teach Arjuna the art of fighting from a horse, from the back of an elephant, on a chariot and on the ground. He instructed him how to fight with the mace, sword, javelin and the dart. He trained him how to use many weapons at one time and how to fight with many men at one time.
Hearing reports of Drona's teachings, princes flocked to him by the thousands. Amongst them came a prince of the Nishadas, named Ekalavya. By caste he was lower than shudra, and fearing that because he was a Nishada, who in time might excel his high born students, Drona refused to accept him. After bowing at Drona's feet, Ekalavya went back to the forest, made a clay image of Drona and began to worship it. He practiced with great zeal in front of this deity of Drona, and in due course all the science of weaponry became known to him.
One  the Pandavas and the Kurus set out for the forest on a hunting excursion. They brought along a dog who could help them search for certain animals. When the dog was wandering in the forest, it saw Ekalavya, the prince of the Nishadas, releasing arrows in all directions. The prince wore black garments and was filthy due to not bathing, as was common among the lower classes. His hair was matted. Seeing this frightful sight, the dog began to bark. The Nishada prince, wanting to exhibit his prowess with the bow and arrow, shut the dog's mouth with seven arrows. The dog then ran back to the Pandavas. When the princes saw the dog, they were struck with wonder and immediately began searching the forest for the archer who had performed such a feat. They soon came upon the unknown bowman and seeing his grim appearance, questioned him, ""Who are you and who is your father?
""I am Ekalavya,  he replied, ""the son of Hiranyadhanus, the king of the Nishadas. Please know that I am a disciple of Dronacharya.
After questioning Ekalavya further, the Pandavas went back to Drona and informed him of what had happened. Arjuna thought that the Nishada prince had come to Drona in secret and learned the art of weapons. He humbly questioned Drona, ""You have embraced me and told me that I would have no equal in archery. How then has this Ekalavya surpassed me?
After reflecting on a proper course of action, Drona took Arjuna to the forest. In the woods they soon came upon Ekalavya. Drona saw his matted hair, ragged clothes and filthy appearance. When Ekalavya saw Drona, he approached him and offered his prostrated obeisances, touching his preceptor's feet. He then stood before his teacher waiting for his command.
""If you are really my disciple,  Drona said, ""then give me my dakshina (payment for tutorship).  Ekalavya was gladdened to hear the words of his preceptor and replied, ""O my teacher, what shall I give you? Command me, for there is nothing I will not sacrifice.
""If you are really intent on making me a gift,  Drona said, ""then please give me your right thumb.  Ekalavya was devoted to obedience, and with an unflinching mind, cut off his right thumb and gave it to his teacher. When the prince tried to shoot again with the use of his right hand, he found that he did not have the same accuracy as before.
One  Drona, the foremost martial teacher, called his disciples together to test their comparative excellence in the use of arms. He had placed an artificial bird on a tree top as the proposed target. He then commanded his students, ""Take up your bows, aiming at the bird in the tree. Release your arrow and cut off the bird's head as I give the order.
Drona then called for Yudhisthira and inquired, ""Do you see the bird at the top of the tree?  Yudhisthira replied to his preceptor, ""Yes, I do.  Drona then asked him, ""Do you see anything else?  Yudhisthira replied, ""I see the tree, myself, my brothers and the bird.  Drona was not pleased and ordered, ""Stand aside! You are not fit to strike the target.
Drona then repeated the experiment with Duryodhana and the other sons of Dhritarastra, and the result was the same. He ordered them all to stand aside. When everyone had failed, Dronacharya called for Arjuna. He commanded him, ""Fix your arrow to your bow and await my order. When I say so, cut off the bird's head.  He then asked him, ""Do you see the bird in the tree.  Arjuna replied, ""I only see the neck of the bird.  Dronacharya again inquired, ""What else do you see? Do you see the tree, your brothers or me?  Arjuna replied, ""I only see the neck of the bird!  With his hairs standing on end out of ecstasy, Drona ordered, ""Release your arrow!  Instantly Partha released his arrow and severed the head of the false bird. Drona immediately embraced Arjuna to his chest, considering Drupada already defeated in battle.
On another  Drona called for Yudhisthira and Duryodhana, and ordered them, ""My dear Yudhisthira, please follow my instructions. Go among the citizens and find someone who has some faults. When you have found that person, bring him to me.  Drona then requested Duryodhana, ""Go among the citizens and find someone who is superior in quality to you. When you find that person, bring him to me.  Both the students then left, and Drona returned to his quarters.
At the end of the  Duryodhana returned to his teacher and informed him, ""O my teacher, I have searched the kingdom for a person who is superior in quality to me, but I have not found anyone. Having concluded my inspection, I have returned to your presence.  Drona then dismissed Duryodhana.
When the sun had set on the horizon, Yudhisthira arrived and offered obeisances to his martial teacher. Drona then inquired, ""Have you found someone of inferior quality?  Yudhisthira replied, ""I have searched all , but I could not find anyone. However, toward the end of the , I saw a vaishya man drawing water from a well, and since it was ekadashi (fasting ), I thought to bring him to you. Just as I was about to arrest him, I saw that he fed the water to his animals. Therefore, I have not found anyone with inferior qualities, but I have brought myself for fault finding with others.  Drona then dismissed Yudhisthira and reflected on the qualities of the two princes. He concluded that Yudhisthira was the personification of humility and fit to rule the people, whereas Duryodhana was too proud to be a pious king and would ultimately ruin the Kuru dynasty.
On another , Drona and his pupils went to the Ganges to bathe in the sacred waters. When Drona had entered the river, an alligator seized him by the thigh. Although capable of killing the alligator, he called to his students, ""Please kill this animal and rescue me!  Instantly Arjuna released five arrows that struck the alligator and killed it. This happened so fast that the others stood looking dumbfounded. The alligator released Drona and died within the waters.
When Drona emerged from the river, he embraced Arjuna and said, ""O best of all warriors, I award you the brahmastra weapon, which is the most powerful of all astras (celestial weapons). It can never be used against an inferior opponent, or it will destroy the whole universe. This weapon has no equal in the three worlds. Keep it with great care and use it only against an enemy who is equal to or greater than you.  Drona then taught the mantras for this weapon to his disciple, and Arjuna received them with great respect. He then pronounced blessings upon Arjuna, ""There will never be a archer greater than yourself. You will never be defeated by any enemy, and your achievements will be recorded in the history of the world.
Thus Drona continued to instruct the sons of Pandu and the sons of Dhritarastra. When Drona felt he had given sufficient instructions to all the boys, he informed Bhishma that he would soon collect his dakshina (student payment) from all whom he had trained."
9,Adi Parv,The Curse of Parashurama,"As stated in chapter six of the Adi Parva, Kunti, before her marriage to Pandu, had conceived a child by the Surya, the sun god. Due to fear of her relatives, she placed the child in a basket and set it afloat on the river Ganges. The child was picked up by Adhiratha, a well known carpenter and chariot driver, and his wife Radha. They were attracted by the beautiful features of the child, especially his kavacha [natural golden armor] and kundala [golden earrings]. He was given the name Karna. They raised the child very carefully for sixteen years.
On Karna's sixteenth birth, his father offered him a new chariot and horses. Not feeling a desire to drive the chariot, he addressed his mother, ""To, father has brought me a chariot and horses, but I do not feel the desire to drive a chariot; I feel the desire to hold a bow and arrow. I cannot think of anything else. Waking or sleeping, my thoughts are ever fixed on this desire. I want to be an archer and fight.
Radha then explained to her foster son Karna all that had happened; how she had found him at the bank of the Ganges wrapped in precious silk and floating in a basket. Hearing about his mysterious past, he was struck with wonder. After consulting with his mother and father, he took permission from them and left for the city of Hastinapura, desiring to find a martial guru.
Karna's goal was to learn archery. He approached the great Drona who was teaching the Pandavas in Hastinapura. After receiving an audience with him, he pleaded, ""My lord, please accept me as your pupil. I want to learn the science of archery. I am the son of Adhiratha, a carpenter and chariot driver by caste.  Drona did not like the idea of teaching archery to the son of a suta (chariot driver) and sent him away.
Karna was determined to learn archery. He decided to approach Parashurama, the chastiser of the kshatriyas. Previously Parashurama had annihilated the warrior race twenty-one times because of the death of his father. Knowing that the great sage hated warriors and kings, Karna decided to tell him that he was a brahmana, a pri st. Actually Karna's foster father was born of a mixed caste, a brahmana and a kshatriya; therefore he decided to request tutorship from the rishi despite the fact that he might be cursed or even killed.
With this plan in mind, Karna approached Parashurama's hermitage. When Karna first saw Parashurama, he was seated in meditation. Upon his head were matted locks of hair, and his eyes were burning like fire. Falling at the feet of this awesome personality, Karna requested, ""I have come to you with a deep longing. Please do not send me away without granting me your mercy.  Karna was weeping and his body was trembling. Parashurama picked up Karna, and asked him, ""Are you a kshatriya?  Karna replied, ""No, my lord, I am a brahmana.  Parashurama smiled at him and said, ""I will certainly impart to you the military science. I am pleased with your humility, and because you are a brahmana, I have a natural affection for you.
Karna's education began, and he spent many months in the ashrama of the renowned sage. He forgot the pain in his heart of being a carpenter's son. He even forgot the mystery attached to his birth. Karna was only interested in education--how to become a powerful warrior. He learned all the astras; even the brahmastra and the very powerful hhargavastra. He pleased his martial teacher in all respects. When his education was complete, Parashurama advised him, ""Your presence in my ashrama has brightened my life. I have taught you the complete science of military arts. You are very honest, fond of those who are elder to you, and you are eager to walk the path of righteousness. You must never use the knowledge I have given you for an unrighteous cause.
It was now noontime, and the sun was at it's meridian. Feeling tired, Parashurama told Karna to bring him a roll of deerskin to use as a pillow. ""My lord,  Karna replied, ""please use my lap as a pillow. I can at least do this service for the foremost of men.  Parashurama then laid his head in his disciple's lap and fell fast asleep. Karna was meditating on all that had taken place over the past year. He had lied to the great sage telling him that he was a brahmana. Would the reaction to this ever come upon him? His only desire was to acquire knowledge. The wise declare that the end justifies the means. He had not tried to commit any sin. Surely his small offense would be forgiven.
As Karna was thinking in this way, he felt a pain in his right thigh. The pain became unbearable. He looked down and saw a boar-like insect cutting into his skin. Karna could not stop it from penetrating his flesh. But what could he do? He did not deem it proper to awaken his guru. The insect bored right through his thigh and blood touched the face of Parashurama. The great brahmana awoke, and seeing the blood exclaimed, ""Where did the blood come from?
""My lord, It came from my thigh,  Karna answered. ""While you were sleeping, an insect bit me on the leg. It caused me pain for some time but I did not want to awaken you.  Parashurama flared up with anger, ""You say this insect stung you, and you tolerated it? Why did you not awaken me and stop the pain?
""My lord,  replied Karna, ""you were asleep, and I did not want to disturb you. For this reason I have tolerated this pain.  Parashurama was furious, ""How could a brahmana bear so much pain? Only a kshatriya could have done so. Have I, after all this time, taught my astras to a sinful warrior? I will never forgive you for this deception.
Karna fell at the feet of his teacher and tears flowed from his eyes thinking that all he had learned would be futile. He held onto the feet of his guru and pleaded, ""Forgive me, my lord. You have been more of a father to me than my own father. A father should forgive the faults of his son. I am not a brahmana, but neither am I a kshatriya. I am the son of a carpenter named Adhiratha. I only wanted to learn the science of archery. I told a lie to you, but it was only to become your student. I have been devoted to you, and you are more dear to me than anything else in this world. Please show mercy and forgive me.
Parashurama was furious, and he was not moved by Karna's prayers. The only thought in his mind was that this person had told a lie and a kshatriya is supposed to be truthful. He then remembered the kshatriyas who had killed his father and, becoming angry, he cursed Karna, ""You have learned the science of archery under false pretenses. I curse you that when you are in desperate need of an astra, your memory will fail you. You wanted fame, however, and I say that here after you will be known as one of the greatest archers of all time.  Parashurama then left and went back to his ashrama leaving Karna in tears.
Wiping the tears from his eyes, Karna began walking aimlessly. He walked for s thinking of the curse of the great rishi. Suddenly, what he thought was a lion flashed by him, and out of instinct, he took an arrow from his quiver and shot the animal. However, it was not a lion but a cow. Karna was horrified. He went to the brahmana who owned it and told him that he had shot the cow in ignorance. Karna tried to appease him, but the brahmana was not to be pacified. He cursed Karna saying, ""When you are fighting with your worst enemy, the wheel of your chariot will sink into the mud, and just as you killed my poor innocent cow when she was unaware of danger, you will also be killed by your opponent when you are least prepared for it.  Karna was stunned that all these things were suddenly happening to him.
Karna then understood that this was his karma. Otherwise how could these events take place without his control. He took it that he was the chosen target of providence and thought how cruel she was. He remembered his mysterious birth and the stigma of his being a sutaputra (son of a chariot driver). He might have overcome it by being the student of the great Parashurama, but his teacher had cursed him and gone away. Now he had been cursed by another brahmana. This was all his fate. He accepted it as such and went back home to his mother. His mother was proud when she heard that he had learned from the great Parashurama, but he did not tell her of Parashurama's curse, or of the curse of the brahmana. After some time he heard about a tournament of weapons at Hastinapura and decided to go there to enter the competition."
10,Adi Parv,The Tournament of Arms,"When Dronacharya saw that his students had been sufficiently educated, he assembled the Kuru elders and informed them, ""O best of the Kuru kings, your children have now completed their education. I suggest there be a tournament of arms where the youths may display their prowess.
""O invincible brahmana,  King Dhritarastra replied, ""you have indeed accomplished something wonderful. I envy those who have eyes and can see the achievements of my children. Vidura will make the necessary arrangements so that all will be able to witness the prowess of these mighty youths.  Understanding the intentions of the King, Vidura left the palace and began making preparations for the tournament of arms.
When the  for the tournament came, all the Kings and elders of the Kuru dynasty assembled in the arena in their respective seats. The ladies headed by Kunti and Gandhari also entered the arena and took their seats on the platforms assigned to each of them. The inhabitants of Hastinapura were so anxious to witness the exhibition that there was an instant crowd at the arena. The whole sky was filled with the sounds of conchshells, drums, kettledrums and trumpets.
Dronacharya entered the arena and announced the students one by one. He then called them forward in their chariots and ordered them to display their prowess with different weapons. With Yudhisthira at their head, the boys came forward and released their arrows at selected targets. Fearing that some of the arrows might miss their target, some of the spectators lowered their heads. However, others fearlessly gazed on in wonder. After exhibiting their skill with the bow and arrow, they showed their ability with other weapons such as the sword and shield, the javelin and celestial darts.
Then Bhima and Duryodhana, both eager for combat, entered the arena with mace in hand. They began to exhibit their energy, roaring like two lions. As they were fighting, Vidura was describing to Dhritarastra and Gandhari all the feats of the two princes. When the fighting became too intense, Dronacharya ordered his son, Ashvatthama, to stop the fight. The spectators in the crowd were taking sides, and the whole atmosphere of the competition became tense.
To ease the mood of the competition, Drona called for Arjuna and announced to the crowd, ""Now all behold Partha, who is dearer to me than my own son. He is the master of all arms, the son of Indra himself.  Arjuna then entered the arena of competition carrying his bow and a quiver of arrows. He was dressed in golden mail and appeared like a streak of lightning in the bright sun. There arose a great uproar of appreciation from the assembly exclaiming, ""This is the graceful son of Kunti! The son of the mighty Indra! This is the protector of the Kurus! Unequalled of those versed in arms! The annihilator of all unwanted elements!  Upon hearing those exclamations, tears flowed from Kunti's eyes and milk filled her breasts.
Arjuna then began to exhibit his celestial weapons. By the agneya weapon, he created fire, and by the varuna weapon he created water. By the vayavya weapon, he created a hurricane, and by the parjanya weapon he created clouds. With the bhauma weapon, he created land, and with the parvatya weapon he brought mountains into being. By the antardhana weapon all these were made to disappear. Within a short time, he exhibited all the astras given by Drona, and the crowd was struck with wonder.
When Arjuna had finished, and the excitement of the crowd had died down, a personality dazzling like the sun appeared at the gate of the arena. Struck with wonder, Duryodhana stood up along with his one hundred brothers. Not knowing who the celestial person was, Drona, as well as the five Pandavas, stood to receive him. He was actually Karna, Kunti's first born son. He was the son of Surya, the sun god and was endowed with his power. Natural golden mail and exquisite golden earrings were a part of his body from birth. The spectators talked among themselves about the unknown person whose effulgence was spreading in all directions. Karna offered his obeisances to the preceptors Kripa and Drona, and then challenged Partha (Arjuna), ""I shall perform feats before this crowd that will excel yours. You will be amazed to behold them.
On hearing these challenging words, Duryodhana was delighted, and his affection for this unknown warrior increased when he saw the rivalry with Arjuna. Karna introduced himself to all present and then with the permission of Drona, he accomplished all that Arjuna had accomplished. Witnessing the superexcellence of this great warrior, Duryodhana and his followers embraced Karna saying, ""Welcome, O mighty-armed warrior! I have obtained you as my friend by good fortune. Live as you please in the kingdom of the Kurus.
Arjuna welcomed the competition and addressed Karna with challenging words, ""Exhibit the weapons you have learned from your preceptor. I shall counter all of them, and prove my superiority with the bow and arrow. Stand and prepare to fight!
""O Phalguna [Arjuna], this arena is meant for all,  Karna replied, ""not only for you. Why do you fight with words only, O Bharata. You may release your arrows until I strike off your head before the great Drona himself!
Encouraged by his brothers, Partha, with the permission of Drona, advanced for combat. On the other side, Karna, having been embraced by Duryodhana, took up his bow and arrows and stood ready for the fight. Indra shaded his son Arjuna with many clouds, and the sun god dispersed the clouds above his son Karna. Understanding that a fatal competition was about to take place, Kunti fainted to the ground. She was brought back to consciousness by Vidura. When she saw her two sons dressed in armor, she was seized with fear.
Kripa, the son of Saradwat, who was conversant with the rules of fighting, questioned Karna, ""This Pandava, the youngest son of Kunti, belongs to the Kaurava race. But, O mighty-armed one, you must also announce the royal dynasty to which you belong. Upon hearing this, Partha will fight with you as he sees fit. Sons of kings never fight with men of lower castes.
When thus addressed by Kripa, Karna's vanity disappeared like a lotus flower during the rainy season. Rising up from his seat, Duryodhana hastily said, ""O Kripa, the scriptures say that there are three classes of persons who lay claim to royalty: persons of royal blood, heroes, and lastly, those who lead armies. If Phalguna is unwilling to fight with one who is not a king, I will establish Karna as the king of the Angas.
At that time Duryodhana called for a golden throne, and seating Karna on it, anointed him King of the Angas. This was done under the direction of some brahmanas well versed in Vedic mantras. He was fanned with yak tails, and the royal umbrella was held over his head. The crowd loudly applauded and signaled their approval. Feeling grateful to Duryodhana, Karna said, ""O tiger among men, what shall I give you that can compare to this gift. I will follow your instructions and become your faithful friend.  And Duryodhana said to Karna, ""I am eager for your friendship.  Thus the two embraced. This was the beginning of a strong bond of friendship that would annihilate the Kuru dynasty.
At that time Adhiratha, the foster father of Karna, entered the arena. He embraced Karna and tears of joy wetted his son's head. Bhimasena thought Karna to be the son of a charioteer, and thus addressed him, ""O suta, do you desire death at the hands of Partha? You are not worthy to rule over the kingdom of Anga anymore than a dog deserves butter from the sacrificial fire.
Hearing these words, Duryodhana rose up in anger, and addressed Bhimasena, ""These are not truthful statements. Heroism and courage in battle are the symptoms of a kshatriya, and even a kshatriya of inferior birth should be fought with. Can a she-deer bring forth a tiger like Karna? Can this warrior, who resembles a demigod, born with natural golden mail and earrings, be the son of a chariot driver? This prince among men deserves the sovereignty of the world. If there is anyone who cannot tolerate what I have done for Karna, let him ascend the chariot and string his bow.
There were mixed feelings in the crowd upon hearing Duryodhana's statements. The sun, however, set on the horizon signaling the end of the s activities. Some thought Arjuna to be the victor of the , and others thought Karna to be the champion. And Kunti, recognizing her lost son by various auspicious marks, was pleased to see him alive and faring well. Upon seeing the gifted genius of Karna, Yudhisthira was convinced that there was no warrior on earth who could equal his bowmanship."
11,Adi Parv,Tuition for Drona,"Drona saw that all his students were now adept in the use of weapons, and therefore their training period was over. It was time to ask for daksheen (tuition) from them. One  he assembled them and gave the following order, ""Challenge Drupada, the King of the Panchalas, to battle. Capture him and bring him to me. This will be suitable payment for my teaching.
All the students readily agreed and mounted their chariots eager to fulfill the desires of their martial teacher. Drona followed them. As the Kurus approached Drupada's capital, they informed the King of their desire for battle. The Kuru army was led by Duryodhana, Karna, Yuyutsu, Duhshasana and Vikarna. King Drupada, not tolerating the attack on his kingdom, mounted his chariot and along with his brothers met the Kuru army head on. Duryodhana and his followers then competed with one another to see who could capture King Drupada first.
Before the battle started, Arjuna saw the vanity of Duryodhana and his brothers. He therefore informed Drona, ""O best of the brahmanas, we shall refrain from fighting until Duryodhana has displayed his prowess. The King of the Panchalas can never be captured on the battlefield by any of these warriors.  Having made his plan, Arjuna, surrounded by his brothers, waited outside the town about a mile away.
Meanwhile, King Drupada, beholding the Kuru army, rushed forward releasing hundreds of arrows from his powerful bow. The Kuru ranks were so afflicted that they thought that there were many Drupadas opposed to them. There arose from the Panchala army a war cry that shook the firmament. Duryodhana and his brothers became furious and began to shower their arrows upon the enemy. But the mighty bowman Drupada was not affected and began killing the enemy with greater vigor. He challenged Duryodhana, Vikarna and Karna, and sent them running from the battlefield. The arrows from the Panchala army began to rain upon the Kurus, breaking their ranks and causing them to flee for their very lives.
The Pandavas, seeing the fun, offered their obeisances to Drona and mounted their chariots. Arjuna asked Yudhisthira to stay in the background and appointed the sons of Madri as the protectors of his chariot wheels. Bhimasena, mace in hand, rushed into the center of the army. He headed for the elephant battalion and began to destroy those huge beasts with a single blow from his powerful club. The elephants screamed and fell to the ground, their heads cracked in many places. With his invincible club, Bhima began to destroy chariots, horses, infantrymen and elephants. As a cowherd man controls countless cows with his staff, so Bhimasena controlled the army of Drupada with his fierce club.
Meanwhile, Phalguna (Arjuna), wanting to please his martial teacher, innundated King Drupada with a deluge of arrows and caused him to fall from the back of his elephant. With his arrows, Arjuna then killed soldiers, elephants, and horses by the thousands. The Panchala army challenged Arjuna head on with a downpour of arrows, and sending up courageous shouts, fought desperately with him. The battle became furious and frightening to behold. The son of Indra was filled with fury and released thousands of arrows intending to annihilate the Panchala army. Those who were watching Arjuna could not see any interval between his fixing the arrows on the bow string and releasing them. The King of the Panchalas, accompanied by his commander in chief, Satyajit, assaulted Arjuna with the speed of the wind. Arjuna covered King Drupada with hundreds of arrows. Partha then rushed at King Drupada to apprehend him. Seeing Arjuna coming forward, Satyajit tried to stop him. As the two warriors approached for combat, they began to destroy each other's army. Suddenly Arjuna pierced Satyajit in the chest with ten arrows. Unaffected by the force of those arrows, Satyajit released one hundred shafts at the son of Pandu. Arjuna, not wanting to waste anymore time, released an arrow that cut the bow of Satyajit in two. Taking up another bow, the commander-in-chief of the Panchalas attacked Arjuna again. This time Arjuna cut the bow, killed the horses and charioteer, and shattered the chariot. When Satyajit found his bow useless and his horses slain, he desisted from fighting.
Seeing his general defeated, the Panchala king began to rain arrows upon the Pandava prince. Arjuna immediately cut King Drupada's bow and pierced his chariot driver with five arrows. Setting aside his bow, Arjuna took out a scimitar and, sending forth a loud battle cry, jumped from his chariot to the chariot of Drupada. He seized King Drupada as Garuda would seize a snake, and at the sight of this, the Panchala army fled the field of battle.
Thus Dhananjaya [Arjuna], having exhibited the strength of his arms, sent up a loud roar and made his way from the battlefield to the presence of Drona. He asked Bhima to desist from any further slaughter, as the Panchalas were related to the Kurus. Bhimasena was unsatiated in battle, but agreed to Arjuna's proposal. They then took the King of the Panchalas to Drona. Drona, seeing King Drupada brought under his complete control, remembered how Drupada had formerly humiliated him in his court.
""I have now taken possession of your capital and your kingdom,  Drona said. ""You need not fear for your life. I once again desire your friendship. O mighty warrior, previously you told me that only one who was a king could be a king's friend. I therefore will give you half of the kingdom south of the Bhagirathi, and I shall rule over the land north of that river. And if it pleases you, I ask again for your friendship.
On hearing these words, Drupada answered, ""You appear to be an invincible brahmana, and your prowess is superior to a kshatriya. Therefore, O brahmana, I am not surprised at what you have accomplished. I am very satisfied with you and desire your eternal friendship.  Drona then released Drupada, and from that  on the King of the Panchalas resided in the city of Kampilya in the province of Makandi on the banks of the Ganges.
King Drupada was convinced that by kshatriya strength alone he could not defeat Drona. He began to wander the earth searching for a sage who could help him obtain a son to kill Drona. He also desired a daughter who would be a suitable wife for Arjuna. King Drupada was so impressed with Arjuna that he thought there was no warrior comparable to him. Therefore, by means of marriage, he wanted to unite the two families."
12,Adi Parv,The House of Lac at Varanavata,"A year after this incident, Dhritarastra decided to appoint Yudhisthira, the first son of Pandu, as the heir-apparent to the kingship of the world. His firmness, fortitude, patience, benevolence, straightforwardness and unswerving honesty won the hearts of the people of the earth. Within a short time, he had overshadowed the accomplishments of his father, the great Pandu.
The second son of Pandu, Bhimasena, began to receive instructions from Balarama, the brother of the Personality of Godhead, Lord Krishna. He received continued lessons in the use of the mace and sword. After Bhima's education was finished, his strength and prowess with the mace were unsurpassed except for the all-powerful Lord Balarama.
Arjuna, the third son of Pandu, was esteemed for his mastery of the bow and arrow. Drona certified that there was none in the world who was Arjuna's equal in the use of weapons. Sahadeva obtained the whole science of morality and duties from Brihaspati, the heavenly priest of the demigods, and Nakula, the favorite of his brothers, became known as a skillful warrior and a great chariot fighter.
Indeed, Arjuna and his brothers became so powerful that they killed in battle the great Sauvira, who was powerful due to his sacrifices to the heavenly gods. The King of the Yavanas, whom Pandu had failed to subjugate, was conquered by the mighty bow of Arjuna. While riding on a single chariot, Arjuna and Bhima conquered the kings of the East backed by ten thousand chariots. The five Pandavas conquered all the kings of the earth and extended their influence to all parts of Bharatvarsha. Seeing the great prowess of the sons of Pandu, Dhritarastra's sentiments towards them suddenly changed. The blind King, who was also blind spiritually, was overcome with envy and began a plot to kill the Pandavas.
Dhritarastra called to his side one of his chief ministers who was expert in the art of politics and inquired, ""O best of the brahmanas, Kanika, the Pandavas are daily growing in power and influence. I am envious of them. Tell me whether I should make peace with them or endeavor to destroy them. I will act on your advice.
Kanika, who was crooked by nature, then ill advised the blind king who was intent on sovereignty for his own sons, ""Listen to my words, O sinless King and do not be angry with me. If your son, friend, brother, father, or even the spiritual preceptor--anyone who becomes your enemy--should be killed by all means. By curses or mystic power, by gift of wealth, by poison or fire, or by deception, the enemy should be slain. To maintain the interests of the Kurus and your own self, you should not let the enemy know what you are thinking. Comfort your foe with sweet words, give him a gift of wealth, and then kill him when he is not looking. You should burn the house of the person you wish to kill. You should act with the greatest cruelty, and sharpen your teeth to inflict the greatest pain. You should strike him in such a way that he will never raise his head again. O King, protect yourself from your brother's sons for they are stronger than your own sons.  The so-called brahmana, Kanika, then returned to his own chambers, and the King contemplated the ill advice of the crooked brahmana.
The citizens of Hastinapura became affectionate to the sons of Pandu because of their good qualities and desired Yudhisthira as their King. In the market places, in the homes, in the countrysides, the glories of the Pandavas were spoken. The sinful Duryodhana, hearing the citizen's discussions, became distressed. Inflamed with envy, he went to King Dhritarastra and said, ""O father, I have heard the words of the citizens favoring the Pandavas. They desire Yudhisthira to rule the kingdom. What then will be our fate? If Yudhisthira does indeed become King, we and our children shall be excluded from the royal line. We should act quickly to acquire the kingdom and win the hearts of the citizens.
Overcome by affection for his sinful son, King Dhritarastra made a plot to kill the Pandavas by fire in the town of Varanavata. One , in the court at Hastinapura, some of the King's counsellors began to speak of the glories of Varanavata. These counsellors, instructed by Dhritarastra, spoke of the beauty of the town and its pious citizens. Hearing these descriptions, the Pandavas became attracted to go there. King Dhritarastra noticed that the curiosity of the Pandavas had been awakened, and he then advised them, ""My counsellors have spoken of Varanavata and the activities that go on there. If you desire to witness the festivities in this beautiful town, then take your followers and friends and enjoy the atmosphere. Give away charity to the brahmanas and the citizens, and after living comfortably for some time, return to the city of Hastinapura.
Yudhisthira fully understood the motives of his blind uncle, but because he was in a helpless condition, he had to agree with the proposal. He took permission from the leaders of the Kuru dynasty and prepared to leave for Varanavata. Previously, Duryodhana had summoned his counsellor Purochana and ordered him, ""O Purochana, this world is destined to be mine, and you can share in it equally. It is in our best interests to protect it. I have no more trustworthy counsellor than you to consult with. Therefore, help me to kill my enemy by doing as I ask. My father will request the Pandavas to go to Varanavata to enjoy the festivities there. I want you to construct a palace made of flammable materials. It should be constructed in such a way as to deceive the Pandavas. Soak the walls with ghee, resin, oil and a large quantity of shellac. Do it in such a way that they will not think it flammable. Make sure the palace is of the finest workmanship, and with the greatest humility, request the Pandavas to live there. On a certain  chosen by me, you will burn the palace of lac while the Pandavas and their mother are sleeping.  Agreeing to all of Duryodhana's proposals, the sinful Purochana went to Varanavata and did all that he was told.
As the Pandavas and their mother were leaving Hastinapura, Vidura approached Yudhisthira and instructed him in a Mleccha (lower class) language which no one else could understand. Vidura lovingly said to him, ""One who knows the schemes of his enemy should act in such a way as to avoid all danger. He who knows that there are sharp weapons capable of cutting the body which are not made of steel, and understands the means of avoiding them, can never be harmed. One who knows that the consumer of straw and wood and the drier of dew never burns the inmates of a hole in the forest, lives to see another . Remembering this, be on guard. One who is given a weapon by his foes that is not made of steel, can escape from his enemies by making his abode like unto the jackal [one who lives underground]. By wandering, a man can acquire certain knowledge, and by the stars he can ascertain direction, and he who keeps his senses under control can never be oppressed by his enemies.
When offered good counsel, Yudhisthira replied, ""I have understood you.  Vidura then bade them farewell and returned to his own house. When Vidura had left, Kunti approached Yudhisthira and questioned him, ""What did the pious Vidura say to you? He spoke in such a way that no one could understand him. If it is not improper for me to know, then I should like to hear everything that he has spoken.  Yudhisthira replied, ""The pious Vidura has told me that the palace in which we are to live is built of flammable materials. He further said, The path of escape will be known to us, and that he who has controlled his senses can acquire sovereignty of the world.' The reply that I gave to him was, I have understood you.'
The Pandavas had set out on the eighth  of the waning moon in the month of Phalguna when the star Rohini was in ascendance. Upon arriving in the city of Varanavata, the townspeople came to greet them. The assembly consisted of many thousands of people who were anxious to see the pious Pandavas. The sons of Pandu were presented many auspicious articles and taken on a tour of the town. The scheming Purochana then took them to the palace made of lac. The foremost of all virtuous men, Yudhisthira, upon inspecting the palace, said to Bhima, ""O chastiser of the enemy, this house is truly made of burnable materials. Our adversaries, by the aid of trusted artisans, have built this house with hemp, resin, straw and bamboos, all soaked in ghee. The wicked Purochana is also staying in this palace to burn us to death when we least expect it. Our well wishing uncle Vidura has warned me that Duryodhana has had this house constructed for our death.
""If this is the fact,  Bhima replied, ""then we should live in another house in Varanavata.
""It seems to me that we should continue living here,  Yudhisthira said, ""seemingly unsuspicious. However, we should always be on guard and know all means of escape. If Purochana has found out that we have understood his plans, he may try to burn the house immediately. If we leave here, Duryodhana may try to have us killed by spies. While we have no rank and power, Duryodhana has both. We also have no friends and allies, and Duryodhana has both. While we have no wealth, Duryodhana has a full treasury. Duryodhana should think that we have died by fire. Deceiving him in this way, we shall escape from here when the occasion presents itself.
After some time, a friend of Vidura's, well skilled in excavation, arrived at the palace of the Pandavas. In private he talked to Yudhisthira, ""I have been sent by Vidura for excavating a tunnel under this house. Purochana will set fire to this palace on the fourteenth  of the dark moon. This is all the plan of the wicked Duryodhana. Previously, Vidura instructed you in the mleccha language, and you replied in the same language. I am saying this so you will know that I am actually acting on Vidura's behalf.
""I know you as a trusted friend of our uncle Vidura,  Yudhisthira replied. ""This large mansion has been built of flammable materials, and there are few doors. I want you to build a large tunnel beginning from the center of the house and ending by the river Ganges. We will spend our s hunting in the forest so that the sinful Purochana will not detect that you are working. Make sure the floor is covered well, so no one will suspect that there is a tunnel.
On hearing these instructions, the miner agreed, and the next  he began his work. Every  the Pandavas would go to the forest accompanied by Purochana, and they seemed very happy to be under Purochana's care. Thus they lived in that palace for one full year.
Seeing the Pandavas living in the palace cheerfully and without any suspicion, Purochana felt content that his plan would be successful. Beholding Purochana in a happy mood, Yudhisthira, the pious son of Kunti, spoke to his brothers, ""The cruel-hearted Purochana has been well deceived. I think the time has come for our escape. Let us set fire to the mansion and burn Purochana to death. Then we shall leave here unobserved by anyone.
Yudhisthira planned a festival in the palace of lac and invited many of the leading citizens of Varanavata. At the end of the night all had left, and Purochana had become so drunk with wine that he lay on the floor unconscious. It so happened on that occasion that a nishada (lower class) woman and her five sons had come to the festival in hopes of receiving charity. They also became drunk and laid on the floor unable to move. They fell fast asleep in a part of the palace that few people frequented. When everyone had left the house, it was late at night and suddenly a violent wind began to blow outside. Yudhisthira ordered Bhima to set fire to the house. Bhima first of all set fire to the place where Purochana was sleeping and then to other parts of the house. Soon the whole mansion was ablaze, and the Pandavas and their mother escaped through the tunnel excavated by the miner. They came out near the bank of the Yamuna, and in the distance, as they looked back, they could see the palace of lac high in flames.
The heat of the fire became intense and awakened the townspeople. Seeing the house ablaze, the citizens with sorrowful faces began to exclaim, ""The wicked Purochana, guided by Duryodhana, has built this death house. O, to hell with Dhritarastra who has such a wicked heart. He has burnt to death the sinless sons of Pandu.
The citizens thus lamented the loss of the Pandavas, and waited the whole night until the flames died down. They extinguished the fire and searched through the ashes. They then found the burnt body of Purochana and the bodies of the nishada woman and her five sons. The people began to weep saying, ""Indeed, this is the plan of the evil Duryodhana. By his wickedness, he has brought about the death of the Pandavas. There is little doubt that Duryodhana has, with Dhritarastra's permission, burnt to death the heirs of Pandu. Let us send a message to King Dhritarastra saying, Your desire has been achieved! You have burnt to death the sinless Pandavas!'
Upon receiving news of the supposed death of the Pandavas, Dhritarastra and Duryodhana were jolly at heart, but outwardly expressed great regret. They arranged for the last funeral rites of the Pandavas, and Lord Krishna Himself attended the ceremony. Neither Vidura nor Lord Krishna were in lamentation because they knew that the Pandavas and their mother were happy and alive. The deceitful Duryodhana felt his desires had been fulfilled, and in due course of time began to rule the kingdom under the direction of his father Dhritarastra."
13,Adi Parv,Hidimba Slain,"While the palace of shellac was burning intensely, the Pandavas escaped unnoticed. Upon immerging from the tunnel, they looked back and saw the palace blazing in the distance. They then looked toward the bank of the Ganges and saw a man sitting in a boat. The man was sent by Vidura, and by signals he indicated that they should board the boat. He convinced the Pandavas by certain messages that he was actually sent by their uncle. The Pandavas then boarded the boat and the boatman lead them across the river Ganges to safety. They thanked the boatman and sent a message back to Vidura that they were heading in a southerly direction.
Then Bhimasena, who was endowed with supernatural power, placed his mother on his shoulders, the twins on his sides, Yudhisthira and Arjuna on his arms, and proceeded quickly through the darkness. The son of the wind god ran at the speed of the wind, breaking the trees and bushes before him. With every step he caused the earth to tremble. The motion of his legs created a wind so intense that it was comparable to the March winds. Indeed, so great was the force with which Bhima moved that his brothers and mother seemed to faint on his body. Before the  was over, Bhima had covered a distance of one hundred and sixty miles.
Towards the evening Bhima reached a densely dark forest where fruits and water were scarce and which echoed terrible cries of wild birds and beasts. The wind blew strongly, breaking the branches of the trees. Afflicted with hunger, thirst, and sleep, they were unable to proceed further. Bhimasena carefully lifted his mother and brothers off his body. Exhausted, they all lay down to sleep with the exception of Bhima, who stayed awake to guard against Duryodhana's spies or any Rakshasas who lived in the forest. As Bhima glanced over his mother and his brothers, he felt a deep pain in his heart. After all it was just a night ago that they were sleeping in the finest beds, and eating the finest foods. Did Queen Kunti, the wife of the great Pandu and the daughter of King Surasena, deserve to lie on the bare ground? Did the sister of Vasudeva and the mother of the Pandavas deserve leaves as a bed sheet? Yudhisthira, the son of Yamaraja, was lying on the bare ground. Did he deserve such a fate? Did he not deserve sovereignty of the three worlds? Did Arjuna, the greatest bowman the world has ever known, deserve to lie on the ground like an ordinary man? Did Nakula and Sahadeva, who are like demigods in appearance, deserve to be soiled by the dust of the earth? Bhima then spoke as if the sons of Dhritarastra were present, ""You sons of Dhritarastra have little foresight. You wicked fellows may enjoy your temporary success. You still breathe only because Yudhisthira does not command me to take your lives. If ordered by him, I would send you all to the region of Yamaraja this very !  Having said this, the mighty armed Bhima squeezed his palms, breathing heavily in anger. Looking over his dear brothers and mother, he continued to guard the rest of the night.
Not far from where the Pandavas were sleeping, there lived a rakshasa (man eater) named Hidimva and his sister Hidimvi. Hidimva was not an ordinary rakshasa for he ruled over all others in his race. He had sharp teeth and a protruding belly. His shoulders were like the neck of a tree, and he was reddish in hue. Longing for human flesh, he sat in a tree along with his sister. Understanding by the scent in the air that some humans were nearby, he ordered his sister, ""O Hidimvi, I smell human flesh close by. My mouth waters at the thought of eating, for I have not satisfied my hunger all . Go and see who has come. Attacking the human throat and opening the veins, I shall drink to my full satisfaction a large quantity of human blood. Go and bring to me any human beings who are nearby. We will feast on human flesh and dance together in happiness.
Thus commanded by Hidimva, Hidimvi proceeded to the spot where the Pandavas were resting. She saw four brothers lying asleep with their mother and the invincible Bhima guarding them. Beholding Bhimasena, unrivalled in strength and handsome appearance, the rakshasi immediately fell in love. She thought to herself, ""This person has a body like molten gold, and his shoulders are like those of a lion. His neck is shaped like a conchshell, and his eyes are like lotus petals. Truly he is worthy of being my husband. I shall disobey my brother's order, because affection for one's husband is greater than for one's brother.
The rakshasi, capable of assuming any form at will, assumed the form of a beautiful celestial woman. Approaching Bhima with a mind enchanting smile, she said to him, ""O bull among men, where have you come from and who are you? Who also, O sinless one, is this lady of transcendent beauty sleeping here so contently as if in her own chambers? Do you know that this forest is the abode of a rakshasa named Hidimva? I am his sister, and he has sent me here with the intention of killing you all. Speaking truthfully, I tell you that after beholding your celestial handsome features, I can accept no one else as my husband. My heart as well as my body have been pierced by the arrows of Cupid. I will rescue you from this brother of mine who eats human flesh. By my mystic power, I will take you wherever you like. Traveling to the celestial gardens, we can enjoy to our hearts content.
Hearing the affectionate words of the rakshasi, Bhima replied, ""O beautiful woman, how can I leave my brothers and mother simply to satisfy lusty desires. I will never run from fear of any rakshasa, for Rakshasas are never able to bear the prowess of my arms. What to speak of Rakshasas, neither mortals nor Gandharvas nor Yakshas can bear my strength. O celestial lady, you may either go or send your cannibal brother. I care not.
Hidimva, the chief of the Rakshasas, seeing that his sister had not returned, got down from the tree and proceeded quickly to where the Pandavas were. He saw that his sister had taken a celestial form bedecked with garlands of flowers and silken garments. The rakshasa, beholding her in that charming form, understood her motives. He was red hot with anger and scolded her, ""Why, O sister, have you thrown obstacles on my path when I am now overcome with hunger? O Hidimvi, don't you fear me in the least? You are desiring to enjoy intercourse with my evening meal. You are ready to sacrifice the good name and honor of all the Rakshasas for some gratification of the senses. Therefore, I will kill you this very moment!
Upon seeing the rakshasa rushing toward Hidimvi, Bhima, the foremost slayer of man eaters, jumped up and exclaimed, ""O Hidimva, what need is there to awaken these sleeping persons. O wicked cannibal, challenge me first, and do not touch your sister. Why do you want to kill a woman who is scarcely responsible for a desire that pervades all living entities? She does not deserve to be punished for this offense. Come and fight with me, O rakshasa, and I shall send you to the court of Yamaraja without delay!
Replying to Bhima, Hidimva said, ""What need is there for all this boasting. Accomplish what you have said and then crow with your tongue! You have wrongly calculated my strength, or else you would not have challenged me to combat. Let your brothers sleep comfortably, and after killing you and drinking your blood, I shall devour them one after another!
The most powerful Hidimva, whose eyes were burning like molten copper, ran at Bhima desiring to kill him. Very quickly Bhima grabbed the outstretched arms of Hidimva and began dragging him away from where his brothers and mother were sleeping. The Rakshasa, humbled by the might of Bhima, became furious, and squeezing the body of Bhima, sent forth a loud roar. The mighty son of Pandu then dragged the demon a further distance so the cries of the Rakshasa would not awaken his brothers. Fighting like two full grown elephants, they pulverized the nearby trees and bushes.
From the sound of falling trees, the sleeping brothers awoke. Kunti also awoke from sleep and gazed in wonder at the beautiful woman who was standing before her. Desirous of knowing her identity, Kunti said, ""O beautiful woman, whose complexion resembles the lotus, where have you come from, and what is your name?  Hearing the inquiry of Kunti, Hidimvi replied, ""The forest that you have taken shelter in belongs to my brother Hidimva, the powerful Rakshasa. I have been sent here to kill all of you on his order. However, seeing the handsome features of your son Bhima, I have fallen in love with him and have chosen him as my husband. My name is Hidimvi. Presently your son Bhima has dragged my brother to a great distance, and they are engaged in combat.
Rising up from sleep and gazing into the distance, Yudhisthira, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva saw Bhima and the Rakshasa engaged in an earth trembling duel. The dust raised by their feet was filling the whole forest. Rushing to that spot, Arjuna requested his elder brother, ""I have now rested from sleep. Step aside and let me kill this Rakshasa.
""Do not fear the result of this battle,  Bhima replied. ""Having come within my reach, he shall not escape with his life.  Blazing with fury, Bhima picked up the Rakshasa and whirled him around a thousand times. Speaking to the Rakshasa, Bhima said, ""To I shall make this forest fit for habitation. You shall no longer feast on human flesh.  Saying this much, Bhima threw the Rakshasa down with all his might, causing a big dust cloud to rise into the sky. The demon uttered a ghastly shriek that filled the whole forest. The mighty Bhima then picked up the battered body of the Rakshasa, and holding it with his hands, bent it backwards breaking it in the middle. This action greatly satisfied his brothers. Seeing the mutilated body of the Rakshasa, Arjuna came forward and congratulated Bhima. They all then headed in the direction of a nearby town. The beautiful Hidimvi followed from a distance.
Bhima, seeing the Rakshasa woman following, ordered her, ""If you seek revenge for your brother's death, do not follow us or your fate will be the same.  Yudhisthira quickly admonished Bhima, ""O Bhima, O tiger among men, however angry you are, never kill a woman. A higher virtue is to protect life. Besides, what can this woman do to harm us?
Hidimvi then respectfully addressed Kunti, ""O blessed lady, you know the heart felt pangs women feel at the hands of the deity Cupid. I have cast off my relations and friends and have chosen your son as my husband. I tell you truthfully that if this desire is not fulfilled, I will no longer live in this body. Have mercy upon me and unite me with Bhima, who resembles a heavenly denizen. Allow him to accompany me to the celestial regions. I shall again return him after some time.
Hearing Hidimvi's appeal, Yudhisthira said, ""Your desire shall be fulfilled in all respects, O beautiful woman. Sport with him during the , but you must return him by nightfall.  Smiling bashfully, Bhima also agreed to the proposal and said, ""I will fulfill your desires, but I will stay with you only till you have obtained a son.  Bhima then climbed on the back of Hidimvi, and she took him to the abodes of the heavenly gods. They enjoyed each others company  after , and in time a child was conceived who was destined to become a mighty warrior. He was named Ghatotkacha. The child was born bald, with fierce eyes and a large mouth. Endowed with the invincibility of the devas, the child soon became a great bowman. Although born an infant, he grew to be a youth within the very hour he was born. Rakshasa women give birth to children the  they conceive. The bald headed child bowed at the feet of his mother and father. Bhima then gave him the name Ghatotkacha, which means bald like a pot. Ghatotkacha became exceedingly devoted to the Pandavas and became a favorite among them.
Then Hidimvi, knowing that her period of stay with her husband had come to an end, offered respects to the Pandavas and told them that she would again seek their company. Ghatotkacha told his father that if he thought of him, he would immediately come to his presence. The mother and son then departed, and the Pandavas continued on their journey."
14,Adi Parv,The Cannibal Baka Slain,"The Pandavas continued on their journey wandering from one country to another. Wanting to remain concealed from the general public, they disguised themselves as ascetics, wearing deerskin and the bark of trees. They saw the countries of the Matsyas, the Trigartas, the Panchalas and the Kichakas. In the course of their travels, the Pandavas came upon their grandfather, the exalted sage Vyasadeva. They offered their obeisances and stood before him with joined palms. Vyasadeva then informed them, ""O best among the Bharata dynasty, I am aware of the wicked plans of Dhritarastra and his sons. Therefore, I have come here with good counsel. You should not lament your fate. In the future this calimity will work in your favor. Just near here is the town of Ekachakra. I suggest you live there in disguise and no harm will come to you. The sons of Dhritarastra will not find you for you have been blessed by higher powers.
Vyasa then satisfied Kunti with sweet words, ""Listen, O daughter, to my words. Your eldest son Yudhisthira, who is ever devoted to truth, will soon rule over all other monarches There is no doubt about this. Backed by the potency of Arjuna's bow and Bhima's mace, Yudhisthira will be the king of this entire earth bounded by the seas and oceans. Your sons and the sons of Madri will together perform many pious sacrifices such as the rajasuya and the ashvamedha. The fame of your sons will spread over the earth and will be known for all time.
After giving these benedictions, Vyasadeva led them to the town of Ekachakra and to the house of a pious brahmana where they could live peacefully. He introduced them to the brahmana, and after situating them properly, he advised them, ""Wait here for me until the time I call for you. Do not be impatient. When the opportunity presents itself, you will succeed in your endeavors.  Vyasa then left Ekachakra and returned to his own hermitage on the bank of the Saraswati.
While living in the town of Ekachakra, the sons of Pandu would daily beg their food. When the 's begging was over, they would gather what they had collected and place it before their mother. Kunti would then divide it in half. One half would be for Bhima, and the other half would be for herself and the rest of her sons. In this way they lived a life as mendicants.
One  while the boys were collecting their food, Kunti and Bhima overheard loud crying and wailing in the brahmana's house. Being very grateful to the brahmana for his hospitality, they wanted to relieve his distress. As Kunti approached the brahmana's quarters, she over heard a conversation between him and his wife. ""To hell with this earthly life,  the brahmana said, ""for it is full of misery. It is hollow like a reed and a fruitless glory. The attachment to wife, children, home and wealth lead only to an unhappy life. When one becomes attached to these and they are then lost, one suffers greatly. How will I escape this danger? How can I sacrifice my son, who all these years I have raised so carefully? If my son or daughter dies then I shall certainly die with them.
Kunti, taking the opportunity, entered the room and spoke soothing words that pacified the brahmana and his wife. Her words were just like nectar that revive dead men. ""Please tell me what is causing your distress. I am certain that my sons or myself can remove any anxiety you feel.
""This speech is indeed worthy of you,  the brahmana replied, ""but I am afraid this grief cannot be removed by any human being. Not far from this town lives a Rakshasa named Baka. Due to the weakness of the local king, this cannibal rules the country. Because he is the chief asura, he protects us from any enemies, but his fee is very high. Every fortnight one of the householders in this town must deliver to him a cart load of vegetables and rice, two buffaloes and one human being. The turn comes to each family only after many long years. If there are any who seek to avoid their turn, the Rakshasa finds and devours them. It has been decided that this fortnight is our turn, and I don't have the money to buy a man-animal, nor can I part with one of my family members, nor can I escape from the hands of that Rakshasa. For this reason I am sunk in an ocean of grief.
Smiling all the while, Kunti spoke to the brahmana, ""Do not be unhappy on account of this danger. I see a way to rescue you from this Rakshasa's grip. You have only one son who is very young, and your daughter is also young and helpless. It also not a good idea for you or your wife to sacrifice your life. So my suggestion is that one of my sons take the offering to this Rakshasa.
Hearing Kunti's offer the brahmana replied, ""To save my own life, I shall never sacrifice the life of a guest or a brahmana. The learned have said that a guest who has taken shelter in one's house should be given protection by all means. Therefore, it is fitting that myself and my wife should perish by the hands of this Rakshasa.
""O brahmana,  Kunti replied, ""I am also of the firm opinion that brahmanas should be protected. My sons are very dear to me, but this Rakshasa will never be able to kill them, for they are gifted with superhuman powers. This second son of mine will faithfully deliver to the Rakshasa his food, but will not be harmed by him. I have previously seen many invincible Rakshasas fight with my son, but in the end they were vanquished. Do not disclose this fact to anyone, for we have many enemies who might harm us.
Thus addressed by Pritha, the brahmana and his wife smiled with pleasure and agreed with her proposal. Her words were like a soothing balm. Then Kunti and the brahmana approached Bhima and asked him to accomplish all that they had talked about. Bhima agreed saying, ""So be it.
Yudhisthira and his brothers, upon returning to the brahmana's house, heard about the proposal and spoke sharply to their mother, ""O Mother, what proposal have you offered to this brahmana without consulting us? You should not have acted so rashly. The learned never allow a mother to abandon her own children. This act will be equal to murder. Why do you want to sacrifice your own child for the sake of another? Relying on the strength of Bhima's arms, we shall certainly vanquish the sons of Dhritarastra. If you are resolved to abandon him, how will we accomplish our goals?
Hearing Yudhisthira's anxious words, Kunti replied, ""Do not be uneasy about Vrikodara. I have not made my decision on account of womanly weakness. Witnessing his bodily strength in carrying us from Varanavata and also in killing the Rakshasa Hidimva, I have great confidence in him. The prowess of Bhima's arms is equal to that of ten thousand elephants. There is no one on earth who can overcome Bhima in strength. Bhima will kill this Rakshasa with the greatest ease. By this act two objects will be accomplished. One is offering gratitude to the brahmana for allowing us to stay here undetected by the sons of Dhritarastra, and secondly, by killing this demon, Bhima's fame will spread far and wide. It is the duty of a kshatriya to protect the brahmanas, and for this reason I have offered to help this pious brahmana.
Having heard his mother's reasoning, Yudhisthira replied, ""What you have done, moved by compassion for this brahmana, is, indeed, the proper choice of action. Bhima will certainly kill this Rakshasa and come back with his life. But tell the brahmana, O mother, that he should not speak to anybody about what is taking place. Make him promise to this request.
The following  Bhimasena, the mighty son of Pandu, loaded the cart full of vegetables and rice, and set out for the place where the Rakshasa lived. As he approached that place, Bhima was eating the food that was intended for the Rakshasa Baka. All the way Bhima was calling out the Rakshasa's name in jest. Hearing his name mocked at and ridiculed, the Rakshasa became furious and came out from the place where he was hiding. The Rakshasa's body was gargantuan, and his power was frightening. He had red eyes, a red beard and red hair, and he was terrible to behold. His mouth opened from ear to ear, and as he advanced toward Bhima, he bit his lips in rage and expanded his eyes in wrath. ""Who is this fool,  he yelled, ""eating my food and desiring to enter Yamaraja's abode? I shall kill him at once!
Laughing at the Rakshasa's angry mood, Bhima continued eating the food in the cart. Seeing Bhima's indifference, the Rakshasa roared frightfully and ran at Bhima with upraised fists, desiring to kill him then and there. He struck Vrikodara on the back with all his strength, but Bhima was not affected in the least and continued eating the food. The mighty Rakshasa, inflamed with wrath, uprooted a tree and ran toward the son of Kunti. Meanwhile Bhima, having finished his meal, washed his hands and stood cheerfully for a fight. As the tree came his direction, Bhima caught it with his left hand, smiling all the while. The Rakshasa was infuriated and uprooted more trees hurling them with all his power at the son of Kunti. Bhima, however, caught those trees and threw them back at the Rakshasa. Soon the forest became treeless and finding no other weapon, Baka ran at Bhima and seized him with his arms. He dragged Bhima on the ground, and Bhima also dragged him on the ground. Soon the Rakshasa became fatigued and Bhima pressed him down to the earth with his knees and beat him with his fists. Then placing one knee on the middle of the Rakshasa's back, Bhima seized his neck with his right hand and with his left grabbed the cloth around his waist. Lifting up his neck and legs, while keeping his knee on Baka's back, Bhima bent him double with great force. The cracking of his back and the screaming of his voice filled the whole forest. Baka then vomited blood and gave up his life force.
The friends of Baka were frightened, and Bhima commanded them, ""Do not kill human beings again, for if you do, you will die as Baka did.  The Rakshasas were terrified at Bhima's power, and from that  on, they were seen by the inhabitants of that town to be very peaceful toward mankind. Then Bhima dragged the lifeless corpse of the demon, placed him on the city gate and went away unseen by anyone.
The next morning the citizens of Ekachakra saw the cannibal's mutilated body covered in blood. News spread quickly through the town and soon a thousand residents were seen at the city gate. They were amazed to see such a superhuman feat, and out of curiosity, they went to the brahmana's home to inquire about the matter. The brahmana was careful to cover-up the identity of the Pandavas, and he told them, ""A certain brahmana traveling on pilgrimage came to my home and agreed to take my place. He assured me that no harm would come to him. He then carried the food cart toward the forest. This wonderful deed has been certainly accomplished by him.  The citizens of Ekachakra were joyous to hear what had happened and held a festival especially honoring the brahmana."
15,Adi Parv,The Svayamvara of Draupadi,"After the killing the Baka demon, the Pandavas continued to reside in Ekachakra as before. One , a brahmana, traveling to different places of pilgrimage, came to Ekachakra and was invited as a guest in the house where they were residing. The Pandavas, wanting to hear some interesting news, inquired from him about anything he had seen in his travels. The brahmana spoke to them of various countries, holy places and sacred rivers. He also told them about the proposed marriage of Draupadi, the daughter of King Drupada. He explained how Draupadi and her brother Dhristadyumna were born from the sacrificial fire and also how Shikhandi was born.
Wanting to hear more in detail, the Pandavas questioned him, ""How, O brahmana, did Dhristadyumna's birth take place from the sacrificial fire? Please also explain the remarkable birth of Draupadi from the center of the sacrificial arena? How also did Drupada's son learn all the military arts from the great bowman Drona?
Thus questioned by those bulls among men, the brahmana began to narrate all they had asked about. He informed them, ""After the great King Drupada was defeated in battle by the Pandavas, that pious monarch wandered among the ashramas of brahmanas well-skilled in sacrificial rites. He was searching for someone who could help him kill Drona and regain his kingdom.
""Once he came upon the sacred river Ganges, and there he saw in an ashrama two sages, Yaja and Upayaja, who were descendants of Kasyapa Muni. They were peaceful and had subjugated their senses. The King made friends with them and daily came to see them. He  invited them to his court. One , King Drupada conversed with Upayaja as follows, O great brahmana, I desire a son who can kill Drona, the preceptor of the Kurus. He has taken half my kingdom and disgraced the Panchala dynasty. If you perform a sacrifice for this purpose, then my desire will be fulfilled. I promise to give you ten thousand cows in charity.'
""The rishi then replied to the King, I cannot perform such a sacrifice.' However, Drupada continued to worship that brahmana, and after one full year, Upayaja said, I desire nothing of this material world, and therefore I will not perform this sacrifice. However, my brother Yaja still covets worldly possessions. Approach him and ask him to perform the sacrifice you desire.'
""Drupada then went to the abode of Yaja and implored him to perform the sacrifice. He pleaded, O brahmana, there is a preceptor of the Kurus named Drona who has unfairly defeated me in battle and taken half my kingdom. There is no kshatriya equal to him on earth. His bow is a full nine feet long, and his arrows are capable of subduing any enemy. His brahminical power combined with kshatriya strength is superior to mine. However, your strength is greater than his, and I request you to perform a sacrifice by which I may receive a son who will be invincible in battle and cause the death of Drona. I promise to give you ten thousand cows in charity.' The brahmana immediately replied, So be it.'
""After Yaja had agreed to perform the sacrifice, the King made all the necessary preparations for the yajna. When everything was prepared, Yaja offered ghee into the sacrificial fire accompanied by the chanting of Vedic mantras. As the flames rose, there appeared from the fire a child who possessed the effulgence of the sun. He was wearing a golden crown and was encased in celestial armor. In his left hand, he held a bow and arrow, and in his right hand, he held a sword. He immediately ascended a chariot and rode about producing thundering roars from his mouth. Suddenly there was a voice from the sky prophesying, This prince has been born for the purpose of slaying Drona. He will dispel all the fears of the Panchalas and spread their fame. He will also remove the sorrows of the King.'
""At this time there also arose from the sacrificial fire a young princess who was blest with good fortune and was comparable to a demigoddess in beauty. Her eyes were black and shaped like lotus petals. Her complexion was dark and her hair bluish and curly. Her nails were raised and the color of copper. She emanated a fragrance like that of a blue lotus, perceivable for a full two miles. Her beauty was such that she had no equal on earth. When she was born, a voice from the sky predicted, This dark complexioned girl will be a crest jewel among women, and she will cause the death of many kings. This slender-waisted girl will accomplish the purpose of the demigods and bestow upon the Pandavas all good fortune.'
""When the family members of King Drupada heard these auspicious omens, they were very happy and roared with joy. The brahmanas then gave the children names. Let this son of King Drupada,' they said,  be called Dhristadyumna. Dhrishta, meaning one who has been born from the fire and dyumna, meaning one who is born with natural armor. The girl shall be called Krishna because she is dark in complexion, and she will also be known as Draupadi, being the daughter of King Drupada.'
The brahmana continued, ""Thus those two children were born from the sacrificial fire of King Drupada. Dhristadyumna was taken as a student of the great Drona even though he was destined to kill Drona. Dronacharya welcomed this as Providence and accepted Dhristadyumna as his disciple, giving him equal instructions with the other students.
Hearing of Draupadi's beauty, the Pandavas appeared bitten by Cupid's arrows. Indeed, the sons of Pandu lost their peace of mind. Then Kunti, seeing her sons inattentive and restless, addressed Yudhisthira and said, ""For such a long time we have been living in the abode of this brahmana. Now we should leave this place. Perhaps the kingdom of the Panchalas would be a suitable place to go. We have not yet seen that country, and it will no doubt, O hero, prove delightful to us.  All the brothers+Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva+agreed, and they prepared themselves to go to the province of King Drupada.
While they were in the midst of their preparations, Vyasa, the son of Satyavati, arrived at the brahmana's house. The Pandavas and their mother offered obeisances and stood before the great rishi with joined palms. They offered him a sitting place, water, food and sweet words. They then waited for the distinguished sage to speak. Vyasadeva advised, ""In the city of Kampilya in the country of the Panchalas lives a king named Drupada. He has a very beautiful daughter named Draupadi who is destined to be your wife. Soon there will be a svayamvara ceremony in which she will choose the husband she desires. Go there and obtain her for your wife, for she will bring happiness to all of you.  Having said this, the great ascetic left and again returned to his hermitage.
The Pandavas then set out for the country of the Panchalas. They traveled along the banks of the Ganges until they came to a sacred place where great sages worshipped Lord Shiva. It was nighttime, and it so happened that a certain king of the Gandharvas was sporting in the water along with his queens. Arjuna was carrying a torch and leading the party along the bank of the river. The King of the Gandharvas, seeing them coming, rose out of the water and ascended his chariot. He picked up his bow, stretching it to full length. He then commanded the Pandavas, ""It is commonly known that the hours of nightfall are set aside for the Gandharvas, Yakshas and Rakshasas to sport in this great river. The hours during the  are for the human beings. I am Angaraparna, the Gandharva, and I am the friend of Kuvera, the treasurer of the heavenly planets. This forest on the bank of the Ganges has been given to me by Kuvera and bears my name. Therefore leave this area if you value your life.
Hearing the challenging words of the Gandharva, Arjuna replied, ""Blockhead, whether it be , night, or twilight, who can bar others from the ocean, the Himalayas, and this sacred river, the Ganges? One can bathe in the Ganges and take advantage of its purification. Because this river flows from the lotus feet of Lord Vishnu, it can cleanse one of all sins. It is meant for all living beings at any time. How then can you stop us from drinking its water?
Angered by Arjuna's words, the Gandharva, drawing his bow to a full circle, released arrows that were deadlier than poisonous serpents. Dhananjaya [Arjuna], wielding a shield and torch, deflected all the arrows released. He then addressed the Gandharva, ""Do not try to frighten those who are skilled in warfare. If you think that you are very powerful then defend yourself from this weapon.  Arjuna then threw his torch which was empowered with the mantras for the agneyastra. The weapon burnt the Gandharva's chariot and deprived him of his consciousness. He fell from his chariot to the ground. Arjuna grabbed him by the hair, and dragging him along the ground, brought him to his brothers. The Gandharva awoke and spoke to Arjuna, ""You have defeated me, and I can no longer boast my strength. I am pleased with you and want to impart to you the science of producing mystic illusions which the Gandharvas possess. I will also bestow upon you one hundred horses that will never tire on the field of battle. These horses cannot be killed and can travel at any speed according to the will of the charioteer. I want in return your weapon of fire.
""I will accept your horses in exchange for my weapon,  Arjuna said. ""Let our friendship last forever. Why have you stopped us from traveling the path along the Ganges? Normally, we have nothing to fear from the Gandharvas. This is a well known pilgrimage path so why have you attacked us in this way?
""Kshatriyas are known to be guided by the brahmanas,  the Gandharva replied. ""You are traveling from a great distance, but there is no brahmana preceeding you. Also no one can distinguish your ashrama although you have completed your brahmacharya (student) training. The fact is that you are not recognizable to human society. For this reason I have challenged you. In the forest nearby is a sacred place called Utkochaka. Dhaumya, the younger brother of Devala, is engaged in penances and austerities. Go there and request him to become your Guru. His superior intelligence will guide you through distressful circumstances.
Arjuna, being pleased with the Gandharva, gave him his fire weapon and told him to keep the horses until the time he called for them. The Pandavas then approached Dhaumya in the forest, and seeing his good qualities, they humbly requested him to become their priest and advisor, for every kshatriya should be guided by a brahmana. Dhaumya developed an immediate attachment for the Pandavas and agreed to become their priest. Indeed, the Pandavas considered themselves so fortunate to have Dhaumya as their guide that they thought Draupadi to be already obtained and their kingdom returned. They requested Dhaumya to accompany them to Kampilya and help them win Draupadi in marriage. Dhaumya agreed, and they all set out together for the kingdom of the Panchalas.
The city of Kampilya was alive with the sounds of musical instruments and the citizens were busily preparing for the svayamvara. Kings and princes from the most noble dynasties had come for the svayamvara. The Pandavas and Dhaumya took up their residence in the house of a potter and witnessed the preparations for the marriage ceremony. King Drupada had a special amphitheater built for the marriage of his daughter. In his heart he wanted only Arjuna to marry Draupadi, and for this purpose he had a unique bow constructed that was so stiff that only Arjuna could string it. Also, if by chance, someone else could string the bow, on the amphitheater ceiling was a wheel, and on the wheel was a fish. The person who strung the bow also had to pierce the eye of the fish, not by looking at it directly, but seeing the reflection of it in a pot of water on the floor. King Drupada felt that only Arjuna could perform this feat. Having arranged the svayamvara in this way, he announced to all the kings of the earth the means by which to obtain his daughter. He was hopeful that Arjuna had not been killed in the house of lac and that this svayamvara would bring him to the city of Kampilya.
On the  of the svayamvara, those kings and princes who had come from different kingdoms entered the amphitheater and took their respective seats. The citizens, anxious to see the outcome of the marriage ceremony, assembled in thousands. The priest for the marriage ceremony lit the sacrificial fire by means of Vedic mantras. When everyone was perfectly quiet, Dhristadyumna, taking the hand of the beautiful Draupadi, spoke to the assembled kshatriyas, ""Welcome to all kings and princes from different lands. Here is my sister, Draupadi, whose beauty surpasses the beauty of all women on earth. To gain my sister in marriage, one must string this strongly constructed bow. When the bow is strung, one must pierce the fishas it lies on the chariot wheel below the ceiling in the eye. One cannot directly look at the fish, but must see it by the reflection in this pot of water. Whoever can achieve this feat will obtain my sister Krishna for his queen.
Having spoken to the assembled monarches, Drupada's son then informed his sister, ""Here, O Draupadi, are assembled the best of the kshatriya race. Here is Duryodhana and his one hundred brothers accompanied by Karna. They have come here to obtain you for a wife. Innumerable other monarches have also come for you. Here is Shakuni, the son of the Gandhara King. He is also accompanied by his brothers. Here is the great bowman Ashvatthama, the son of Drona. Here is King Susharma with his five brothers, and here is the very powerful Jarasandha. There is King Virata along with his two sons, Sankha and Uttara. There is King Paundraka and King Bhagadatta who are counted amongst the great maharathis. The King of Kalinga has come as well as the King of Madras, Salya, whose strength equals thousands of elephants. There, sitting in front of you, is Krishna, the son of Vasudeva and His very powerful brother Balarama. Also from the Yadu dynasty have come Satyaki, Kritavarma and Akrura. There are many kings from the Vrishni dynasty as well as powerful kings from the Kuru race. There is Somadatta and his three sons Bhuri, Bhurishrava and Sala. Also here is King Shishupala. All these warriors as well as many others have come to gain your hand in marriage. Endowed with unsurpassable might, they will endeavor to pierce the eye of the fish.
Gazing upon the loveliness of Draupadi, all the princes and kings stood up anxious to exert their strength. They all became jealous of each other exclaiming, ""Draupadi shall be mine!  They were all infatuated by the celestial beauty of King Drupada's daughter, and some were so drunk with that beauty that they could barely walk. The demigods assembled in the sky in their stellar airplanes to witness the event. The whole arena became alive with excitement, and the Pandavas, dressed like brahmanas, stood up to get a better view of the beautiful princess. Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, seeing the Pandavas sitting amongst the brahmanas, leaned over and spoke to Balarama, ""O son of Rohini, sitting in the midst of the brahmanas is Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva.  Lord Balarama glanced in the direction of the brahmanas, and seeing the Pandavas looking intently upon Draupadi, smiled with satisfaction.
One by one the kshatriyas came forward to string the bow. They were all adorned with crowns, garlands, golden armlets and other ornaments. They were full of enthusiasm and energy. However, most of them could not even string the bow. Indeed, in the attempt, they were knocked to the ground when their strength proved insufficient. Some, such as Duryodhana, were able to string the bow, but missed the fish's eye by the width of a finger. The great Salya missed the target by the width of a bean seed. Shishupala, the son of Damaghosa, was able to string the bow, but missed the target by the width of a sesame seed. Jarasandha was the next to try. He was able to string the bow, but missed the target by the width of a mustard seed. Seeing no one able to pierce the target, Karna, the foremost wielder of the bow and arrow, rose from his seat and approached the bow. Everyone was watching him with tense excitement. The Pandavas regarded the eye of the fish as already pierced. He quickly strung the bow and placed the arrow on the string. However, Draupadi loudly exclaimed, ""I will not select a suta as my lord.  Karna released his arrow, but missed the target by a hair's breadth.
When none of the great kings were able to fell the target, Arjuna in the dress of a brahmana stood up and inquired from Dhristadyumna, ""Is a brahmana allowed to take part in this competition? I see that no king or prince can hit the target.  His fearless eyes swept over the assembly of monarches with a contemptuous look. ""Yes,  Dhristadyumna replied, ""anyone can take part in the competition. Come forward and string the bow, and if you can, pierce the target.  Arjuna then picked up the bow and stood there like a mountain. Remembering Lord Krishna in his heart, he quickly strung the bow and set his arrow. There was not a sound in the audience. All eyes were on Arjuna. Looking at the reflection of the fish in the water, Arjuna raised his bow toward the ceiling. He slowly drew back the string to full length and let loose his arrow, which pierced the fish's eye causing it to fall to the ground. There was an uproar amongst the demigods in the firmament, and the amphitheater resounded with joy. The demigods began to shower flowers upon Arjuna, and the brahmanas waved their upper garments in the air. The kings, who had been unsuccessful, were shocked with disbelief. The whole arena was filled with the sounds of drums, kettledrums, cymbals and conches. And thinking the brahmana to be Arjuna, King Drupada was smiling from ear to ear. The beautiful Draupadi, whose smiling eyes resembled lotus petals, then approached Arjuna and placed the garland of victory upon his neck.
Unable to tolerate King Drupada bestowing his daughter upon a brahmana, the assembled kings contemptuously bellowed, ""This Drupada has insulted us deliberately. The Vedic statement is that the svayamvara ceremony is meant for the kshatriyas and not for the brahmanas. Since the brahmanas are to be protected, we can do nothing to harm this one who has pierced the target. However, in order to avoid total disgrace let us kill this Drupada.
After speaking to one another in this way, they picked up their weapons and rushed at King Drupada to kill him. And Drupada, seeing the kings and princes approaching him, took shelter of Arjuna. Arjuna smiled reassuringly at him and told him, ""Do not fear! I am able to handle all of them.  In order to counteract the weapons of the enemy, Bhima uprooted a tree and stood next to his brother. Yudhisthira, Nakula and Sahadeva also stood ready for combat.
Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, addressed His brother, ""That hero there, who walks like a lion and wields a bow four cubits in length, is Arjuna! There is no doubt of this. Look at that brahmana standing with an uprooted tree in his hand. That must surely be the second son of Pandu, the mighty Bhima. The tall youth who walks like a lion and is kingly in stature is Yamaraja's son, Yudhisthira. The other two handsome youths are the sons of Madri, Nakula and Sahadeva. They have not died in the house of lac after all.  Lord Balarama, smiling at His brother, said, ""This is good news, My dear Krishna. I am happy to hear that our Aunt Kunti and her five sons are alive.
While Lord Krishna and Balarama were speaking, the kings approached Arjuna for combat. The brahmanas stood up to help Arjuna, but he assured them that he could handle the whole situation himself. Karna then rushed against Arjuna, and Salya rushed at Bhima. Duryodhana fought with Yudhisthira, and Shakuni fought with Nakula and Sahadeva. Arjuna counteracted all the arrows of Karna, and Karna, becoming furious, fought with greater vigor. Unable to defeat his opponent, Karna addressed him, ""O foremost brahmana, I am amazed to see the strength of your arms in combat. Are you Parasurama, or the great Indra himself? Could you be the younger brother of Indra, the infallible Lord Vishnu, disguised to defeat me in battle? No one can defeat me except for the son of Sachi or Arjuna, the son of Pandu.  Hearing these words, Arjuna replied, ""O Karna, I am not Parasurama, Indra or the eternal Lord Vishnu. I am only a brahmana, and I have learned the science of archery from my preceptor. I am here to vanquish you in battle.
Karna then desisted from fighting for fear of angering a brahmana. Meanwhile, Bhima, engaged in battle with Salya, picked him up and threw him a distance without hurting him. No one could understand who the brahmanas were, and being unable to defeat them, they stopped their advances. Arjuna, followed by his brothers and Draupadi, left the arena of competition and went back to the potter's house. Lord Krishna, desiring to help the Pandavas, followed from a distance."
16,Adi Parv,The Pandavas Marry Draupadi,"When the Pandavas entered the potter's house, they called out to Queen Kunti, ""Mother, come and see what we have collected to.  Kunti was inside the house, and without seeing her sons she said, ""Whatever you have brought to shall be shared equally among you.  The next moment she saw Draupadi and exclaimed, ""Oh, I have spoken too soon.  They then informed her of the events that had taken place that . She took the daughter of Drupada by the hand and approached Yudhisthira, ""The daughter of King Drupada has been given to me as the alms collected for the . In ignorance I have spoken the words, Share equally what you have obtained.' O best among the Kuru race, tell me how my words will not prove false.
Thus addressed by his mother, Yudhisthira reflected for a moment and then ordered Arjuna, ""To, you have won Draupadi. It is proper, therefore, that you marry her. Ignite the sacrificial fire and wed her according to the Vedic rites.
Hearing the order of his elder brother, Arjuna declined, ""I do not want to take part in any sinful activities. You are the oldest, and according to the Vedic injunctions, the older brother must be married first. Once you are married, then the rest of us will marry according to our birth. We, therefore, await your decision after due deliberation.
Arjuna's remarks were full of respect and devotion for his elder brother. After Arjuna declined to accept Draupadi, all the brothers cast their glance at the beautiful princess, and Draupadi also looked upon all the Pandavas with affectionate glances that captivated their hearts. Understanding what was within their minds, Yudhisthira, fearing division, decided, ""The beautiful Draupadi shall be our common wife!  With these words, all the brother's faces blossomed like lotus flowers.
After the Pandavas had left the svayamvara assembly at Drupada's palace, Lord Krishna and Balarama had followed them. Lord Krishna is the universal Godhead and is very kind to His devotees. The Pandavas are all His eternal associates, and Lord Krishna wanted to benedict them with His association, which is hankered after by all pure devotees. Lord Krishna entered the house of the potter along with His brother Balarama. There They saw the Pandavas sitting around their mother, and They also saw Draupadi. Lord Krishna then approached Yudhisthira and offered His obeisances saying, ""I am Krishna, the son of Vasudeva.  The Lord then touched the feet of Queen Kunti. Balarama did the same. Krishna then embraced Arjuna because they were the same age and accepted the obeisances of Nakula and Sahadeva. Lord Balarama embraced Bhima because they were the same age and accepted the obeisances of Arjuna and the twins.
Yudhisthira then inquired from Lord Krishna, ""O Vasudeva, how did you detect us though we have been living in disguise?  Lord Krishna was smiling and then answered Yudhisthira's inquiry, ""O King, fire, even if it is covered, can never be concealed. Who else but the Pandavas could exhibit such prowess as was shown to? It is by good fortune that you have escaped the burning house of lac. Those evil sons of Dhritarastra could not carry out their wicked plans. Remain hidden for some time, and do not let the sons of Dhritarastra know where you are until you have made alliances. You have the support of the Yadu and Vrishni dynasties. Do not fear anything. We must leave soon so that no one will know we have come here.  Then obtaining King Yudhisthira's permission, Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Lord Balarama, His immediate expansion, left the potter's house and returned to Their own abodes.
There was also someone else who had followed the Pandavas to the potter's house. It was Dhristadyumna, the son of Drupada. He was anxious to find out who had gained his sister in marriage. After Lord Krishna and Balarama left the house, he came close to the window to listen to their conversation. Kunti was talking with Draupadi about the food that they had collected that . ""First, take a portion and offer it to Lord Vishnu,  she said, ""then distribute it to the brahmanas and guests. Divide what is left into two portions. One portion is for Bhima, for my second son is ever hungry.  Bhima turned red from embarrassment and Draupadi smiled. Dhristadyumna saw the happy expressions on her face and was glad to know that she was not sad or depressed. Queen Kunti continued, ""The other portion can be divided amongst the other four brothers and ourselves.  Draupadi then did as she was told. After her husbands had eaten, Draupadi took her portion of prasad (food offered to Lord Vishnu).
When they were finished with their evening meal, the sun was setting. Sahadeva then laid a bed of kusha grass on the floor. Deerskins were laid on top of the kusha grass, and the brothers lay down to sleep. Kunti lay at their heads and Draupadi at their feet. They talked about chariots, bows, arrows, maces, elephants and armies. Dhristadyumna overheard their whole conversation, and then after they had fallen asleep, he went back to the palace of his father.
King Drupada was lamenting, unsure of who had taken his daughter. After returning from the potter's house, Dhristadyumna entered the palace and offered obeisances to his father. As his son stood before him, King Drupada inquired, ""Oh my son, where has Krishna [Draupadi] gone? Who has taken her away? Has a shudra of the lower orders abducted her? Has a vaishya taken her and polluted my dynasty? Has a kshatriya of high birth taken her away from my palace, or has a brahmana obtained my daughter in marriage? O my son, I would feel greatly happy if Draupadi has been united with Partha, that foremost warrior. Please tell me who has won my daughter. Are the sons of Pandu alive? Was it Arjuna who took up the bow and pierced the mark?
Dhristadyumna then related all that he had seen during the night. He then told his father, ""From their conversation I can understand that they are not shudras, vaishyas or brahmanas, for their talk was only on military topics. Their voices were deep and commanding. They are definitely heroes of the highest order. It seems, O father, that our hopes have fructified. From the way in which the mark was shot down by the youth, and the strength in which the bow was strung by him, and the manner in which I have heard them talk with one another, I conclude that they are the sons of Pandu wandering in disguise.
King Drupada regained the hope that he had cherished in his heart. He sent his priest and other messengers to the potter's house to announce that the wedding would be that , and that they should come to the palace. Drupada sent valuable dresses for Draupadi, and he also sent valuable clothes and ornaments for the five heroes whom he hoped were the Pandavas. A royal chariot then arrived at the potter's house to bring them to the palace. The Pandavas and their mother as well as Draupadi ascended the chariot and soon arrived at the palace.
Queen Kunti, upon entering the palace, was taken away by the ladies of the King's household and worshipped according to her position. Draupadi went with her. The Pandavas then entered the palace, and King Drupada saw those bulls among men dressed in deerskin and walking with the gait of lions. Each had broad shoulders and long arms extending to the knees. He could understand that they were of royal blood and offered them the finest seats. He fed them all with the finest food, and after they were fully satisfied, inquired from them, ""Are we to know you as kshatriyas, brahmanas or demigods in disguise? Tell us the truth for we have great doubts. Hearing your reply, I shall make arrangements for my daughter's wedding according to the order to which you belong.
Thus questioned by King Drupada, Yudhisthira replied, ""Do not be unhappy, O King. Your cherished desire has been fulfilled. We are kshatriyas and the sons of Pandu. Know me to be the eldest of Kunti's sons, Yudhisthira, and here is Bhima, by whose prowess all the earthly monarchs were humbled yester. Here is Arjuna, whose expert bowmanship has won your daughter. Here also are Nakula and Sahadeva and our mother Kunti. O foremost of kings, drive away the distress in your heart. Your daughter, O Monarch, like a lotus flower, has been transferred from one lake to another. O King, you are our chief refuge and our worshipable superior.
Drupada's eyes rolled in ecstasy, and he almost lost consciousness. His voice was choked, and for a moment he could not reply to the statements of Yudhisthira. With great effort he inquired how they had escaped from the house of lac. Yudhisthira related everything, and hearing what had happened, King Drupada condemned Dhritarastra for his diplomacy. Drupada then vowed to support Yudhisthira and help him regain his paternal throne.
King Drupada was overjoyed that the Pandavas were now living in his kingdom, and he requested them, ""According to the Vedic injunctions, let the Kuru prince Arjuna take my daughter in marriage on this auspicious .  Replying to the King, Yudhisthira said, ""O great King, the shastras declare that the oldest son must be married first.  King Drupada replied, ""If it pleases you, take my daughter yourself, or give Draupadi in marriage to whomever of your brothers you like.  Yudhisthira then said, ""Your daughter, O King, shall be the common wife of all of us. It has been ordered by our mother. This jewel of a daughter has been won by Arjuna. It is a standard rule amongst us that we enjoy equally what we obtain. That rule of conduct we shall not abandon. Krishna [Draupadi] shall become the wedded wife of all of us.
King Drupada was confused by Yudhisthira's decision, ""O scion of the Kuru race, it has been declared that one man may have many wives. But it has never been heard that one woman may have many husbands. O son of Kunti, you are conversant with the rules of morality and opposed to sinful acts. Please tell me, O Prince, on what basis have you made your decision?
As they were discussing, the great Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa appeared on the scene. He was given a proper reception and an elevated seat. King Drupada then inquired, ""O esteemed sage, you very much welcomed in my court. At this time there is something that is troubling us, and I am sure that you can settle the matter. Please tell me how one woman can become the wife of many men without being touched by sin.
Wanting to speak with Drupada in private, Vyasa arose from his seat and took the monarch by the hand, leading him away to his quarters. The others waited for the return of the great sage. Vyasa then explained that in Draupadi's previous birth she had prayed to Lord Shiva to obtain an elevated husband. Since she asked Lord Shiva five times, Shiva appeared before her and and gave her a benediction that she would have five husbands. Vyasadeva then informed King Drupada that the Pandavas in their previous births were demigods and eternal associates of the Supreme Lord. Vyasadeva then granted divine vision to Drupada so that he could see who the Pandavas were in their previous lives. King Drupada was then convinced that it was the desire of higher authorities, and he agreed to the marriage proposal.
The  the marriage ceremony took place, the moon had entered the constellation of Pushya which is considered very auspicious. King Drupada planned a grand and opulent ceremony. The palace was decorated beautifully. Flags and festoons hung from the ceilings of the different rooms and thousands of multi-colored garlands were draped everywhere. The whole palace was alive with excitement, and people were moving here and there making the necessary preparations. When the marriage ceremony bagan, Dhaumya, the priest of the Pandavas, lit the sacrificial fire with mantras recited from the Vedic literatures. He then called the Pandavas one by one and had them circumambulate the fire, each holding the hand of Draupadi. King Drupada then bestowed upon the Pandavas an opulent dowry consisting of one hundred golden chariots, each drawn by magnificent horses with golden bridles. He also gave them one hundred elephants endowed with auspicious marks. He gave jewels, gold, bedding, carpets and maidservants. He gave all this out of affection for his beautiful daughter.
After the marriage ceremony was over, Lord Krishna, the Infallible Lord, sent to the Pandavas many presents such as golden ornaments set with pearls and lapis lazuli, many beautiful and soft blankets, carpets and golden chariots. He also gave them many well- trained elephants and many excellent horses. He gave them hundreds and thousands of gold coins and many precious jewels. Yudhisthira, feeling great devotion, accepted all those gifts from Lord Krishna, whom he always thought of in the core of his heart."
17,Adi Parv,Khandavaprastha,"News spread quickly that Draupadi had been married to the Pandavas, and that Arjuna was the brahmana who had pierced the eye of the fish and defeated Karna in battle. Everyone thought that the Pandavas had died along with their mother in the house of lac. They now regarded the Pandavas as persons resurrected from the dead. They remembered the cruel scheme of Purochana and cursed Dhritarastra again and again. After the svayamvara was over, all the kings and princes returned to their respective kingdoms. When Duryodhana heard that Draupadi had selected Arjuna as her lord, he was greatly despondent. He left the city of Kampilya accompanied by his brothers, Ashvatthama, Shakuni, Karna and Kripa. Understanding that the mighty sons of Pritha had escaped from the house of lac and were allied with King Drupada, the sons of Dhritarastra were embarrassed and frustrated that their plan had not succeeded.
When Vidura learned that Draupadi had been won by the Pandavas and that Duryodhana and his allies had been humiliated, he was elated. Approaching Dhritarastra, Vidura exclaimed, ""The Kurus are faring well by the grace of God!  Dhritarastra thought that Vidura was referring to his sons and that Duryodhana had won the competition for Draupadi. He immediately ordered ornaments made for Draupadi and that Duryodhana and his new wife be brought to Hastinapura in great pomp. It was then that Vidura told the blind King that Draupadi had chosen the Pandavas as her lords. Vidura told Dhritarastra that the Pandavas were alive and well. He also informed his brother that the Pandavas had made a pact of friendship with the family of King Drupada and also many other families including the Yadu and Vrishni dynasties.
Dhritarastra pretended he was cheerful to hear news of the Pandava's success and well being. Actually the news broke his heart. He said to Vidura, ""To hear that the sons of my brother are living is good news. They are more dear to me than my own sons. I am delighted to hear that they now have many friends and that the great Drupada is their ally.
""Let this realization remain within your heart for one hundred years,  Vidura replied. Vidura then returned to his own residence.
Duryodhana then approached his father pouring grief from his evil heart, ""The Pandavas have now become invincible by the will of Providence. O Father, we should now act to weaken their strength. The time has come to assemble the Kurus and discuss how the Pandavas may not swallow us.
""You should be happy,  King Dhritarastra replied, ""and I will do whatever you recommend. But I do not wish to inform Vidura of this meeting. If you have some plan, then reveal it here so it will remain a secret.
The sinister Duryodhana then revealed his thoughts, ""Let us, O Father, by some means produce dissension between the sons of Kunti and the sons of Madri. Or let us win to our side King Drupada by means of gifts and wealth. Perhaps we can send spies who can kill Bhima, and without his strength, the Pandavas can be easily defeated. Or maybe we can send some celestial girls to the Pandavas as a gift, and Draupadi, being neglected, will leave them. By some means we must deflate the power of the Pandavas.
Karna then spoke his mind, ""O Duryodhana, your reasoning is not well founded. O brave Prince, you have tried many times to kill the Pandavas by subtle methods, while they were living in the palace and still young. Now they have matured and are more powerful in strength. How then will you defeat them by these methods? Also it is impossible to disunite them. Draupadi chose them when they were in poverty. Will she now neglect them when they are in prosperity? King Drupada is honest and truthful, and by no means can we tempt him with gifts. Dhristadyumna has made a strong pact of friendship with the Pandavas which cannot be broken by offers of wealth. I think we should now attack them, and by our power decimate them from the face of the earth. We should attack now when they are not prepared. Exert your prowess before the Yadu and Vrishni dynasties are able to support the Pandavas. Prowess is the symbol of a kshatriya. We should assault them, supported by our large army, and grind Drupada and the Pandavas into the earth.
King Dhritarastra applauded Karna's opinion as heroic. ""You are gifted with intelligence and power,  he said. ""But before we take action, let us take counsel with Bhishma, Drona and Vidura, and adopt a plan of action that will suit our purpose.
King Dhritarastra then summoned Bhishma, Drona, Vidura and other elders to the court. When asked by Dhritarastra to give his opinion, Maharaja Bhishma replied, ""O Dhritarastra, I would never advise a quarrel with the Pandavas. I have affection for you in the same as I have affection for Pandu, and of course, I look upon your sons as well as the sons of Pandu equally. I think a settlement should be concluded and half the kingdom should be given to them. As Duryodhana looks upon the kingdom as his own, so the sons of Kunti look upon it as theirs. In fact, they are the lawful heirs to the throne. If you act aggressively, a sinful reaction will befall you. You will be veiled with dishonor and will lose your good name. Are you aware how the citizens talk about you? The citizens have more affection for the Pandavas, and if you kill them, what will be your fate? It is said that a person has lived in vain who loses his reputation. A person who becomes famous because of his good deeds lives eternally. O Duryodhana, follow the path worthy of a Kuru king. We are fortunate that the Pandavas and their mother have not perished. We are fortunate that the sinful Purochana was not successful and that he himself was killed. From the time I heard that the sons of Pandu had been burnt in the house of lac, I could not face any citizen of the state. O Duryodhana, upon hearing about the attempted murder of the Pandavas and their mother Kunti, the world does not blame Purochana as much as it blames you. As long as the Pandavas live, they cannot be deprived of their rightful share, even by the powerful Indra. They are being deceitfully kept from their inheritance, and therefore you should give them half the kingdom.
After Maharaja Bhishma had finished, Drona gave his opinion, ""Bhishma has spoken wisely. We must give the Pandavas half the kingdom. Messengers should be sent to the kingdom of the Panchalas with a gift of wealth for the Pandavas. Let Yudhisthira know that both yourself and your son are truly happy that they are alive. Also, you should make an alliance between the Kurus and the dynasty of King Drupada. The Pandavas should be invited to Hastinapura and greeted like kings. Those exalted princes should be brought to Hastinapura and given their rightful claim. Yudhisthira is the heir to world sovereignty. Therefore, let him become king. This will bring joy to all the people of the world.
After Drona had given his opinion, Vidura said, ""O King, Bhishma and Drona have wisely spoken as your well wishers. However, I doubt you can accept their advice because of affection for your son. Bhishma, the son of Shantanu, always gives you good counsel. Drona, the preceptor, has never once offered any ill advice. Without a doubt, O King, both of these great men are comparable to Lord Ramachandra and the great King Gaya. These two great souls have never harmed you. The words of your son and the words of Karna will lead to the extinction of your dynasty. The Pandavas can never be defeated in battle. Arjuna alone is able to subdue all these princes. With Krishna, the eternal Lord, and Balarama as their allies, how do you think you can usurp the kingdom? Duryodhana, Karna and Shakuni are sinister and foolish; and if you remember, I predicted at Duryodhana's birth that he would cause the annihilation of this dynasty. Do not influenced by sinful people.
Hearing the advice given by the Kuru elders, which was meant for his welfare, Dhritarastra concluded, ""The learned Bhishma, and the great Rishi Drona, and you also, O Vidura, have spoken the truth. The sons of Pandu are entitled to a share of the kingdom as are my sons. Therefore, O Vidura, go to the Panchala kingodm and induce the Pandavas to come here along with their wife Draupadi. Take with you various presentations such as jewels, horses, chariots and gold. It is by good fortune that the sons of Pandu are still alive.
Vidura then went to the city of Kampilya and requested the Pandavas to come to Hastinapura. With the permission of Lord Krishna and King Drupada, the Pandavas started for the city of elephants. As the Pandavas approached the city of Hastinapura, certain heroes of the Kuru dynasty, such as Vikarna, Drona, Chitrasena and Kripa of Gautama's line, came out to greet them. The whole city became alive as the Pandavas approached. The citizens gathered in thousands and showered flowers upon the saintly Pandavas. The affectionate sons of Pandu enlivened the citizens as the sun enlivens the lotus flower in the early morning. The Pandavas heard the words of the citizens as they moved through the crowd. Some of them said, ""Here is Yudhisthira, the first son of Pandu, conversant with all the rules of morality, and who always protects us as if we were his nearest relatives.  Other citizens said, ""It seems that King Pandu, the foremost among the descendants of the Kuru dynasty, has returned to after a long absence. If we have ever given in charity, if we have ever performed any pious activities, let the Pandavas remain in this great city for one hundred years.
The Pandavas entered the city to the sounds of trumpets, bugles, conchshells, drums and kettledrums. The citizens waved their upper cloths and threw flowers before the procession of those pious souls. Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva as well as their mother Queen Kunti entered the palace at Hastinapura in state. They worshipped the feet of King Dhritarastra as well as grandfather Bhishma and then entered the rooms assigned to them.
After they had rested for some time, they were called to the court by King Dhritarastra and Shantanu's son, Bhishma. When they had been seated properly, Dhritarastra spoke to them, ""Listen, O Yudhisthira, to what I have to say. I want you to reside in Khandavaprastha so that no quarrels may arise between yourselves and my sons. I am sure if you live there no harm will come to you, protected as you are by the strong arms of Partha. You may rule over this half of the kingdom.  Agreeing to the commands of their uncle, the Pandavas made arrangements to travel to Khandavaprastha.
 After Yudhisthira was crowned the King of Khandavaprastha, he, along with his brothers and their beautiful queen, set out for that tract of land. The history behind this half of the kingdom is that at one time it had been the capital of the Kuru ancestors, but due to the curse of the rishis, it had turned into a barren waste. Nothing would grow there and no animals lived there. As far as the eye could see, there was nothing but desert. Lord Krishna had accompanied the Pandavas and upon seeing the situation summoned Indra, the King of heaven, and ordered him, ""The Kuru monarch has magnanimously given this tract of land to the Pandavas. I want you to pour rain over this entire region and make it beautiful. Make it so fertile that the finest fruit trees and most fragrant flowers will grow in this region. Also the finest crops should grow in the land of Khandavaprastha. From this time on, because you will beautify this region, it will be known as Indraprastha. Make it as beautiful as Indraloka.
Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then called for Vishvakarma and ordered him to construct a city for the Pandavas. By his mystic power Vishvakarma was able to construct a beautiful city that was dazzling in all respects. Vyasadeva was there to consecrate the new city with mantras from the Vedic hymns. The city was indeed beautiful with its nicely aligned roads and symmetrical houses. The mansions were made of first class marble, and the walls, inside and out, were embedded with precious gems. At different places within the city there were gardens of a transcendental nature. Within the gardens were small lakes decorated with different colors of lotus flowers. These gardens were filled with fruit trees of every description, and beautiful birds such as the peacock, cuckoo, parrots and chakravakas were seen here and there. When the city was complete, men and women from all classes came to live under the protection of the saintly sons of Pritha. All these citizens were pious and devoted to the cause of the Pandavas. With Lord Krishna living in the city as the most beautiful ornament, Indraprastha appeared like Vaikuntha, the spiritual world.
After some time Lord Krishna took leave of the Pandavas and returned to His capital city Dvaraka. The celestial sage Narada then came to Indraprastha. He was received in the palace of the Pandavas with great respect. Draupadi also came and offered her respects to the great sage, and after receiving benedictions from him, retired to her own chambers. Narada then advised the Pandavas in private, ""This beautiful princess is your common wife. Some rule must be established so that you do not quarrel amongst yourselves. In former s there lived two brothers named Sunda and Upasunda who were inseparable and could not be killed by anyone. However, when they saw the beauty of the heavenly apsara Tilottama, they quarreled over her and killed each other. Do not let this happen to you.
Hearing these words of wisdom from the great sage Narada, the brothers decided that Draupadi would live with each of them for one year at a time. If it so happened that one of the brothers were to enter another brother's palace where Draupadi was staying without permission, that brother must enter the forest for one year as a punishment.
After establishing this rule, the Pandavas resided happily in Indraprastha. One  providence arranged that some thieves stole the cows of a certain brahmana. The brahmana came to Indraprastha and complained to Arjuna. Arjuna said he would help the brahmana, but that he could not do it immediately, for his bow was in the chambers where King Yudhisthira and Draupadi were sitting. The brahmana wanted immediate action before the thieves went too far. Arjuna had to surrender to the brahmana's demands and entered the chambers where Yudhisthira and Draupadi were residing. He told King Yudhisthira why he had entered and then took his weapons. Arjuna seated the brahmana on his chariot and with great speed followed the same path the thieves had taken. Following their tracks, he soon caught and pierced them with his arrows. He retrieved the cows and the satisfied brahmana bestowed his blessings upon Arjuna. Arjuna then returned to Indraprastha. At that time Partha approached King Yudhisthira and said, ""Give me permission, O lord, to fulfill the vow that we had all taken. I had entered the room when you were sitting with Draupadi. I shall, therefore, enter the forest for one year.  King Yudhisthira tried to persuade him from his resolution, but it was no use. Arjuna was determined to go to the forest."
18,Adi Parv,Arjuna Goes on Pilgrimage,"After leaving Indraprastha in the dress of a mendicant, Arjuna came to the bank of the Ganges. He entered the celestial waters to bathe, and while coming out he was seized by some unknown force. Actually it was Ulupi, the daughter of the King of the snakes. She was overcome by the handsome features of Arjuna and thus bitten by Cupid's arrows. She took him below the waters of the Ganges to her mansion. Arjuna then addressed her smilingly, ""O beautiful girl, you have certainly performed a rash act! Where have you brought me and whose daughter are you?
""There is a Naga (snake) king named Kauravya,  Ulupi replied, ""born in the line of Airavata. I am, O Prince, the daughter of that king and my name is Ulupi. O tiger among men, seeing you bathing in the waters of the Ganga, I have been bitten by the arrows of Cupid. O sinless one, I am still unmarried, and if it pleases you, I can become your wife.
""I have entered the forest for one year  Arjuna said, ""to perform atonement for breaking a promise to my brother Yudhisthira. I am not free to act in any way I like. I must strictly undergo the vow of brahmacharya for the period of one year. How, therefore, can I fulfill your desires?
""I know why you are wandering the earth,  Ulupi replied. ""Draupadi is your common wife, and by accident you have entered the room where she was sitting with Yudhisthira. Thus you have broken a vow that was made in this connection. But this vow of celibacy is only in relation to Draupadi. Therefore, O Arjuna, it is your duty to relieve my distress. I am your worshiper, and if you do not accept me, I will give up this life.
Thus supplicated by the daughter of the Naga king, Arjuna, the son of Kunti, did everything that she desired. The mighty Arjuna spent that night in the mansion of Ulupi, and in the morning she took him back to the bank of the Ganges. Before leaving she gave him a benediction, ""You will be able to defeat every creature of the waters.
Arjuna then traveled to the base of the Himalayan mountains and then east toward the ocean. He then came to the province of Manipur, and desiring to meet the king of that country, he went to his palace. The King of Manipur was Chitravahana, and while in his court, Arjuna happened to see Chitrangada, the beautiful daughter of the King. He was astonished by her beauty and immediately petitioned the King for her hand in marriage. Not recognizing Arjuna because of his ascetic dress, the King inquired, ""Who are you, and to what dynasty do you belong?
""I am Arjuna, the son of Pandu and Kunti,  Arjuna replied. The King informed Arjuna, ""There was a previous monarch belonging to our dynasty whose name was Prabhanjana. Although he had many queens, he was childless. He underwent severe penances and austerities, and thus he pleased Lord Shiva, who granted him the benediction of a child. However, Lord Shiva told him that each successive king would also only have one child. Each of my forefathers has begotten a son, but I have given birth to a daughter. I will give you my daughter on the condition that the son born from her will be given to me as the next king of Manipur.  Arjuna agreed to the proposal, and thus he married Chitrangada and lived happily for three months in that kingdom.
Arjuna then traveled on pilgrimage to different places in South India. At one holy tirtha, he delivered the Panchapsaras. These Apsaras (beautiful heavenly maidens) were cursed by a great rishi to become alligators. They were cursed to take that form for one-hundred years. Arjuna came to that sacred lake and pulled all five alligators out of the waters. The alligators immediately returned to their normal features as beautiful Apsaras. They then thanked Arjuna and left for the heavenly planets.
Arjuna then went north to the city of Dvaraka. When the sons of the Vrishni dynasty were learning archery from Drona at Hastinapura, Arjuna's good friend had been Gada, one of Lord Krishna's cousins. Gada had told Arjuna about his cousin Subhadra. Arjuna had heard so much about her beauty that he always thought of her. Arjuna was curious and wanted to see her. He thought that since he was dressed as a mendicant, no one would recognize him. With this in mind, he went to Prabhasakshetra near the city of Dvaraka. Arjuna sat underneath a banyan tree, and suddenly it began to rain. He thought deeply of Lord Krishna and hoped He would help him. Lord Krishna was staying that night in the palace of His wife Satyabhama. He had heard that a sadhu had arrived at Prabhas, and because He is the Paramatma within everyone's heart, He knew that it was Arjuna. Lord Krishna began laughing, and wanting to know about the situation, Satyabhama questioned Him. He then replied to her, ""My cousin Arjuna has been on pilgrimage for several months and now has come to Dvaraka seeking marriage with Subhadra. Indeed, his heart is filled with thoughts of her. He is sitting under a banyan tree at Prabhas in the pouring rain. I must go and welcome him to Dvaraka.
Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the benefactor of His devotee, then went to Prabhas in the rain and greeted His friend who was sitting under a banyan tree. They embraced, and Lord Krishna was smiling to see His friend in the guise of an ascetic. Arjuna told Krishna of his plan to marry Subhadra, and Krishna agreed to the proposal. Lord Krishna then took Arjuna to Raivataka mountain and told him to reside there for a few s.
One  there was a procession of the Yadus and the Vrishnis traveling to the holy Raivataka mountain. They were coming to worship the gods in the temple. In that procession Arjuna saw the beautiful Subhadra, and as he was contemplating her features, he felt that someone was near him. Arjuna looked up and saw it was Lord Krishna. Smiling, Lord Krishna said, ""The attraction in your eyes doesn't seem to fit the dress you are wearing.  Arjuna replied, ""Please do not tease me. Tell me the truth. Is that Your sister Subhadra who just passed in the procession?  Krishna replied, ""Yes, that is Subhadra. If you are very interested in her, I will tell My father about your desire.  Arjuna said, ""I want to marry her. Please tell me how she can become my wife.  Krishna replied, ""I think if you sit in the temple courtyard there, everything will take its destined course.  Lord Krishna then left and mingled with His relatives.
Arjuna, in an ascetic's dress, then sat in the courtyard of the temple, and when the worship in the temple was over, the members of the Yadu dynasty headed by Lord Balarama came out and saw the young sage sitting under a tree in deep meditation. The son of Rohini was impressed with the young sage and went over to him. Arjuna was very nervous because he knew of Balarama's anger. Lord Balarama was already in favor of handing His sister over to Duryodhana. Therefore Arjuna had to be careful not to reveal his identiy. Lord Balarama fell prostrate before the young sannyasi and asked him who he was and why he had come to Dvaraka. Arjuna told Lord Baladeva that he was on pilgrimage, and that since it was the rainy season, he needed somewhere to stay. The carrier of the club and plough then suggested the gardens of His sister Subhadra, since it would give a chance for His sister to serve a great ascetic. Besides, He lived close by and the sannyasi could take his meals occasionally at His palace.
Lord Krishna came up to them at this time and offered obeisances to the so-called sannyasi. Lord Krishna was playing the part of an ordinary human being and to set the example for society in general, He offered obeisances to the sannyasi although the whole world bows down to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. Lord Baladeva then told Krishna of His plan, and Krishna expressed His displeasure, ""I do not think it advisable for this ascetic to associate with our sister. We don't know anything about him. He is young and handsome, and Subhadra could be attracted to him. But You are wiser than I am, and ultimately you should make the decision.  Lord Balarama replied, ""This sannyasi has traveled all over the world and has completely controlled his senses. There is no harm in letting him stay in Subhadra's gardens.
Lord Krishna, acting like an ordinary human being, agreed and took Arjuna to meet Subhadra. Krishna introduced the so-called sannyasi to His sister and informed her of the desires of Lord Baladeva. Subhadra then took the ascetic to the gardens and gave him a place to stay. She served him  after  by getting him water and food to eat. Arjuna would  go to the palace of Lord Balarama and take his meals there. Subhadra would come too, and Arjuna would always look upon her beautiful features. Balarama was much pleased with the great ascetic. Subhadra  could not understand why the ascetic looked at her with burning eyes.
In the city of Dvaraka the name of Arjuna was a household word. When young children challenged each other, it was in the name of Arjuna; and if elders blessed young children, it would be in hopes they would become like Arjuna. Subhadra had heard much about Arjuna, especially from Gada. She developed an attraction for Arjuna by hearing about him, just as Rukmini had developed an attraction for Lord Krishna by hearing His glories. Lord Krishna would also tell her about the wonderful qualities of Arjuna; and if anyone came from Indraprastha, she would inquire about Arjuna from them. From the descriptions given by all these persons, Subhadra began to think that maybe this sannyasi was Arjuna.
One  Subhadra began to question him, ""People say that you have traveled all over Bharatvarsha. In your travels surely you must have visited Indraprastha. In that city lives my aunt Kunti and my cousins, the Pandavas. Have you met them?  The so-called sannyasi said that he had.
""I have heard,  Subhadra continued, ""that Arjuna has been away from Indraprastha and traveling on pilgrimage like you are. Have you by chance met him?
""Oh yes,  Arjuna replied, ""I have met him. In fact, I know where he is at the present moment.
""Where?  asked Subhadra in an excited voice.
""I will tell you,  Arjuna replied, ""Arjuna has taken the dress of a sannyasi and is sitting in your garden. How is it that you have not recognized me so far?  Subhadra's face turned red and she looked down. She didn't know what to say. Arjuna explained that he was very attracted to her and wanted to marry her. She listened without speaking a word of reply, and then went away to her chambers.
Lord Krishna, the Omniscient Lord, is the Supersoul of every living entity. He knew the inner desires of both, and thus he went to Arjuna and told him to kidnap her as was the custom amongst the kshatriyas. Arjuna went to Vasudeva and Devaki and took their permission; and on the right , when Subhadra was visiting the temples of the devas, Arjuna grabbed her by force and took her away. Lord Krishna had given Arjuna His own chariot which was drawn by His horses, Saivya, Meghapuspa, Sugriva, and Balahaka. After taking the beautiful Subhadra on the chariot, he headed in the direction of Indraprastha with the greatest speed.
Everyone soon learned that the so-called sannyasi was Arjuna and that he had forcibly taken Subhadra away. Balarama was furious and wanted to kill Arjuna. Lord Krishna came before Him and pacified Him. He said, ""Do not be so angry, My dear brother. Let us consider what has happened. Subhadra has accompanied Arjuna willingly. In fact she readied My chariot and horses and even drove the chariot for Arjuna. Surely she has chosen Arjuna as her lord. What better husband could we have chosen for our sister? He is the brightest jewel in the house of the Kurus. Our families are now more closely allied. Let us go to Indraprastha and make peace with them.  Balarama was convinced by the arguments of His brother and His anger ceased. They all then made plans to attend the wedding ceremony of Arjuna and Subhadra in Indraprastha.
Meanwhile, Arjuna reached the city limits of Indraprastha. He thought of Draupadi and how she would be angry about what had happened. He told Subhadra, ""Draupadi will be angry. You must win her affection first. Go to her in the dress of a cowherd girl and say that you are her maidservant. Then tell her that you are Subhadra, the sister of Krishna. She will be charmed, and if she finds out later that I have married you, it will not matter.  Subhadra followed Arjuna's instructions.
Subhadra then went to the chambers of Draupadi in her simple cowherd dress. She offered obeisances to Draupadi and said, ""I am the sister of Krishna, Subhadra. Please consider me your maidservant.  Draupadi embraced her and blessed her with sweet words, ""May you be the wife of a hero and the mother of a hero.  They sat down and talked for hours about Lord Krishna and Dvaraka.
Suddenly, there was a commotion in the streets of Indraprastha. It was announced that Arjuna had arrived. The streets became crowded, and everyone was overjoyed to see their hero return. They showered him with flowers and spoke of him in sweet words. He soon reached the palace and was greeted by his brothers. He went to Draupadi and inquired if she had heard any news. Draupadi said, ""I have already met the cow herd girl. She is very beautiful and welcome in the palace.
Within a few s the Yadus headed by Lord Krishna and Balarama entered the city of Indraprastha and were given a royal reception by the Pandavas and the citizens. Together they celebrated the marriage ceremony of Arjuna and Subhadra. Many costly presents were given by the Yadus and Vrishnis, and after enjoying the ceremony, they went back to Dvaraka City. However, Lord Krishna remained in Indraprastha just to give His association to the Pandavas."
19,Adi Parv,"Devouring of the Khandava Forest","It was now summertime and the heat had become unbearable. Arjuna went to Lord Krishna and suggested, ""Dear Krishna, let us go to the Yamuna. We can spend the  there and come back in the evening.  Lord Krishna welcomed the proposal, and they made preparations to go to the Yamuna River, near the Khandava forest. The ladies, including Draupadi, Subhadra, and Satyabhama, also went on the excursion. They set up an encampment near the bank of that sacred river. Leaving the ladies in their tents, Lord Krishna and Arjuna rode in their chariots along the Yamuna bank.
They soon came upon the Khandava forest, which was so thick with trees that no sunlight could penetrate it. It was inhabited by ferocious animals and was the home of the serpent king Takshaka. The whole forest had a terrifying appearance to it. Lord Krishna and Arjuna sat on a fallen tree at the perimeter of the forest and began talking.
While the two heroes were conversing, a certain brahmana came to them. This brahmana had a complexion like molten gold. His eyes and beard were both red. Lord Krishna and Arjuna stood up to offer respect to the brahmana. They seated him and asked if they could satisfy him with any service. The brahmana then said, ""I know You, Lord Krishna, to be the Supreme Godhead and you, Arjuna, to be His eternal companion. Therefore you are both capable of fulfilling my desires. I am very hungry, and wish that you satisfy my hunger.
""If you tell us what kind of food you desire,  Arjuna replied, ""then we will try to satisfy you to the best of our ability.
""I do not eat ordinary food,  the brahmana said. ""Actually, I am Agni, the fire god. I have been waiting a long time for you both to come here. Previously, in a sacrifice to the demigods, I had been offered too much butter, and now I am suffering from sickness. The only cure is to devour this Khandava forest. However, every time I try to ignite it, Indra descends and safeguards it by pouring water from the heavens. He has a friend living in the forest named Takshaka, a certain king of the serpents whom he protects, and it is for this reason that I am not successful. I know that you both are expert in the divine astras; and if you can ward off the rain, then I can successfully devour the Khandava forest.
Upon hearing this unusual request, Arjuna said, ""It is a fact that Krishna and I possess the divine astras. However, I do not own a suitable bow that is capable of bearing all of them. If I am to continue releasing arrows, I must also possess a quiver of arrows that is inexhaustible. I also require a chariot that is comparable to the sun and fine white horses with the speed of the wind. Then also Krishna needs some weapon with which to kill the serpents and ghosts that inhabit this region. If you can supply us with these necessities, then certainly we can help you.
Thus petitioned by Arjuna, the fire god Agni called for the demigod Varuna and appealed to him thus, ""Here is Lord Krishna, the Supreme Person and His companion Arjuna. They are in need of certain weapons. You have in your possession a divine bow given to you by Soma and also two inexhaustible quivers of arrows. Please offer them as gifts and also supply the finest chariot drawn by white horses. Please give these for Arjuna is in need of them.
""These things that you ask for,  Varuna replied, ""eternally belong to these two great heroes. Here is the celestial Gandiva bow along with two inexhaustible quivers of arrows. This bow equals a hundred thousand bows and cannot be destroyed by any weapon. This multicolored bow that resembles a rainbow will enhance your fame and achievements.
After handing over the Gandiva bow, Varuna then gave Arjuna a golden chariot drawn by four white horses obtained from the regions of the Gandharvas. This chariot was invincible and could not be destroyed by the celestial denizens or the Asuras. It delighted the heart of anyone who saw it. Arjuna was emotional with gratitude. He offered obeisances to Agni and then forcefully strung the multi-colored bow. Whoever heard the twang of that bow was struck with fear. Varuna then gave the Sudarshana chakra to Lord Krishna.
""Formerly, my dear Lord, this weapon belonged to You,  Varuna said. ""It has been used to vanquish the demons and the asuras. I am returning it to You after a long time. Here also is Your mace named Kaumodaki, which is capable of killing every demon on earth or in the lower regions. Please use these weapons to again establish religious principles.  Lord Krishna and Arjuna thanked Varuna and prepared to help Agni to fulfill his desires.
Agni then ignited the Khandava forest. The forest was soon surrounded on all sides by burning flames. All the living creatures in the forest were from demoniac species, and as they came out of the forest to escape the heat, they were killed by the arrows of Lord Krishna and Arjuna. As the flames rose in the forest, they seemed to reach the sky, and the demigods became alarmed. Indra, upon seeing the forest being consumed by Agni, caused dark clouds to appear over the region and pour torrents of rain. Water hit the fire causing the forest to be filled with smoke, and in combination with flashes of lightning, the forest became fearful to behold. Then the son of Pandu invoked his astras and covered the entire forest with his innumerable arrows that were as thick as fog.
It so happened that on that  Takshaka, the serpent King, was not in the forest. However, his son Aswasena was present and tried to escape the fire, but could not get outside the network of Arjuna's arrows. Aswasena along with his mother rose into the sky, and as they were making good their escape, Arjuna killed the mother. Indra saw all this, and desiring to save his friend's son, deprived Arjuna of his consciousness by a violent wind. While Arjuna was regaining his consciousness, the son of Takshaka escaped.
When Arjuna saw this, he became furious and wanted to fight with the powerful Indra. He began to release thousands of arrows that filled the whole sky. Indra then produced fierce winds that roared loudly. Masses of clouds began to vomit thunder and terrible flashes of lightning charged with thunderclaps were heard and seen in all directions. Arjuna then released the vayavya weapon to disperse the clouds sent by Indra. When the clouds were destroyed, the sun appeared in the sky again. Colossal birds then appeared and attacked Lord Krishna and Arjuna. Also innumerable Nagas (snakes), with mouths emitting poison and fire, attacked those two heroes. Seeing them approaching, Arjuna cut them to pieces with his arrows. Deprived of their lives, they fell into the fire below.
Indra next sent Asuras, Gandharvas, Yakshas and Rakshasas, who bellowed loudly causing the hearts of all to tremble. They poured upon Arjuna a deluge of arrows, but Partha struck off their heads with his own arrows. Indra, desirous of testing his son's strength, caused a heavy downpour of stones to fall upon Arjuna. Arjuna, however, destroyed that shower of rocks. Indra then released a mountain weapon. Arjuna cut that mountain top into thousands of pieces, and it fell into the forest, causing great distress to the demons and Rakshasas living there. They rose up to escape, but were killed by the discus of Lord Krishna.
When Indra and the demigods saw that Lord Krishna and Arjuna could not be defeated, they glorified the prowess of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Suddenly an unembodied voice from the heavens announced, ""O Indra, your friend Takshaka has not been slain. He has presently gone to Kurukshetra . It is impossible for you to defeat Lord Krishna and Arjuna, for they are Narayana and Nara. Krishna is Narayana, the Supreme God, and Arjuna is Nara, his eternal companion. They are invincible in battle. They deserve the worship of all the demigods in heaven. You should, therefore, leave with the host of demigods; the destruction of the Khandava forest has been ordained by fate.  Hearing these words, Indra, the destroyer of the Paka demon, left for his own abode accompanied by the demigods.
As the Khandava forest continued to blaze, an asura of the name Maya tried to escape from the abode of Takshaka. He was chased by Agni as well as Lord Krishna, who was ready to kill him with His disc. Seeing his certain death, Maya ran to Arjuna for shelter pleading, ""Protect me, O Arjuna!""
""You need not fear for your life,  Arjuna called out. ""You will not be harmed.  Because the demon took shelter of Arjuna, Krishna and Agni desisted from chasing him. The fire continued to rage for hours until the whole forest was burnt to ashes. Then Agni came to Lord Krishna and Arjuna and thanked them for their help. Due to devouring the forest, his health was now restored. Lord Krishna and Arjuna then returned to their camp."
20,Sabha Parva,Maya Danava Erects the Imperial Court,"Before Lord Krishna and Arjuna had gone a great distance, the demon Maya Danava fell at their feet pleading, ""You have spared my life, and for this I am very grateful. My name is Maya Danava, the architect of the demons. Please allow me to show appreciation for your merciful act.""
Since the demon was looking at Arjuna, Arjuna replied, ""I do not want anything in return for saving your life. It is my principle never to accept charity for performing a good deed. However, if you want to offer a gift, then ask Krishna what you can do for Him.""
Lord Krishna thought for a moment and said, ""You are the architect of the demons, capable of performing many wonderful feats. The Pandavas are very dear to me, and, therefore, I want you to construct an imperial court for them that will excel all on earth."" Maya Danava readily agreed, and together they departed for Indraprastha.
Upon reaching the royal palace, Arjuna related to Yudhisthira all events that had transpired in relation to the burning of the Khandava forest. Maya Danava was then introduced to Yudhisthira, who welcomed him with great honor. Maya Danava greatly appreciated the humility of the King and considered him a saint amongst the kshatriyas. They then began discussions about the construction of an assembly hall that would have no equal in the universe. Maya Danava chose a plot of land that was 90,000 feet square to begin his work.
Now that Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, had lived Indraprastha for some time, He desired to return to His own capital, Dvaraka. The Pandavas were very reuluctant to let Him go. ""You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead,"" Yudhisthira lovingly said; ""that brightest moon that guides our boat to safety. You have given us everything, and, therefore, how can we agree to Your leaving us at this time? You are Hrishikesha, the master of our mind and senses. Please stay and always direct our thoughts and actions.
Lord Krishna declined the loving offer of Yudhisthira, but reassured His devotee that He would return whenever Yudhisthira called for Him. Lord Krishna then took leave of His Aunt Kunti, who affectionately smelled His head and embraced Him. He satisfied His sister Subhadra with sweet words and bestowed many blessings upon her. Then Lord Keshava ascended His chariot, and Yudhisthira took up the reins. Arjuna and Bhima stood on either side and fanned Him with chamara whisks. Nakula and Sahadeva stood behind, holding an umbrella over the Lord of the universe.
When the chariot had gone about two miles, Lord Krishna requested the Pandavas to return to their capital. He then affectionately bade farewell to the five brothers and proceeded toward Dvaraka. The Pandavas could not take their attention off the Supreme Person because of His exquisite beauty. Their eyes followed Him a great distance until He could be seen no more. They were unsatiated with the sight of Lord Krishna, and their minds accompanied Him to the city of Dvaraka. The Pandavas returned to the city of Indraprastha, but they always contemplated the transcendental qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
 Maya Danava was busy with preparations for constructing the great assembly hall. He approached Arjuna and informed him, ""Near Mount Kailasa there are many jewels that I have secretly hidden. To the east of Mount Kailasa there is also a lake called Bindu, wherein lies a mace that was thrown by a king of the demons after killing his enemies. That mace is equal in power to a hundred thousand maces. It is a fit weapon for Bhima, even as the Gandiva is for you. Also, in the lake is a large conchshell named Devadatta which belongs to Varuna. The blast of that conchshell can be heard in all directions. I will bring that conch as a gift."" Maya then took leave of Arjuna and wenl to Mount Kailasa.
Maya Danava searched for his great quantity of jewels and found them. He also entered Lake Bindu and found the powerful club and the conchshell Devadatta. He took those back to Indraprastha and presented the club to Bhimasena and the conchshell to Arjuna. The sound of this conchshell could break the heart of any opponent.
Maya then began to construct the great royal assembly house. It took him a full fourteen months, but it was, indeed, magnificent. The columns were golden and radiated an effulgence like the sun itself. The walls were embedded with thousands of multi-colored jewels, and the effulgence of the precious gems illuminated the entire palace. Within the palace Maya Danava placed water ponds that were lined with highly polished stone and filled with lotuses whose leaves resembled dark colored emeralds and whose stalks were made of precious jewels. There were also other flowers with golden leaves. The water was crystal clear and filled with a variety of fishes and tortoises of a golden hue. The pond was surrounded by a flight of crystal stairs, and it was difficult to understand where was water and where was land. Flowers inside and outside the palace bloomed in all seasons and were the finest variety.
When the palace was completed, Maya Danava informed Maharaja Yudhisthira, and a great celebration was planned. Thousands of brahmanas came and invoked auspiciousness by chanting the Vedic hymns. Maharaja Yudhisthira gave thousands of cows in charity and fed the brahmanas sumptuously. He then entered this most opulent royal assembly court accompanied by his brothers. Kings and sages from every country came to see the wonderful Sabha (Royal court), and upon seeing it, they were struck with wonder. The fame of the assembly hall built by Maya spread far and wide, and even the demigods came to see it. Some of the princes who visited at this time stayed in Indraprastha to learn the science of archery from Arjuna. Chief amongst these princes was Satyaki, or Yuyudhana. He was a cousin of Lord Krishna. This was a happy time for the Pandavas, but it was like the lull before the storm. They were destined to enjoy their kingdom for only a few months more.
During this time Subhadra gave birth to a son named Abhimanyu. He was born with many auspicious marks. The astrologers foretold that he would be a great warrior and add fame to the Pandava dynasty. Draupadi also gave birth to a child by each of her husbands. From Yudhisthira, Prativindhya took birth, and Bhima's son was Sutasoma. Arjuna's son was Shrutakirti. Nakula's son was Sataneeka, and Sahadeva's son was Shrutasena. The sons matured with the good qualities of their fathers, including mastering the science of weapons.
One  while the Pandavas were sitting in their imperial assembly court, the great rishi Narada Muni came to see them. The Pandavas rose with excited hearts and offered their respects to the great sage. They seated him properly and washed his feet, offering him all kinds of presentations for his pleasure. Narada Muni was then shown the royal assembly hall by Maharaja Yudhisthira, and Narada appreciated the wonderful workmanship. When Narada was again seated, Yudhisthira began to inquire from the exalted sage, ""My dear lord, you have traveled through the three worlds, and seen many elegant imperial assembly halls like the one I have. Can you tell me about them?""
""Yes, I have seen all the great sabhas of the universe,"" Narada smilingly said. ""I will tell you about them. However, I have never seen an assembly hall anywhere that was built of such rare precious stones and jewels. This sabha defeats the beauty of the Sudharma imperial court in the heavenly planets.""
Narada then described the different assembly houses, such as those of Indra and Yamaraja. He told Maharaja Yudhisthira that in the imperial court of Yamaraja there were many kings from the Kuru house, including Pandu and others. Narada then went on to describe the royal courts of Varuna and Kuvera.
When the narration was finished, the hall was silent. Narada waited for Yudhisthira to speak. ""My lord,"" inquired Yudhisthira, ""I have been listening to all the descriptions of the differnet sabhas, and I have noticed one thing. Most of the kings who were lords of this earth are all in the assembly house of Yamaraja rather than Indra's. Even my father, the great Pandu, was not in Indra's abode, as I was thinking all these years. I have heard from you that Harischandra of the solar dynasty is sitting on the throne of Indra. What pious activities did Harischandra perform that my father did not? My father was the purest of men and never spoke a word of untruth. He was a saint amongst the kingly order. Please tell me why my father is not in the court of Indra.""
Narada, who had come just to discuss this point, replied, ""Certainly, I shall tell you. The great Harischandra was the son of Trishanku, the favorite of the sage Visvamitra. Harischandra was a powerful monarch and had conquered all the kingdoms of the earth. Because of his pious activities, he was able to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. For this reason he is able to share the same throne with Indra. The king who performs the Rajasuya sacrifice receives immense benefit in the heavenly realm. While I was in Yamaraja's abode, I met your father. He told me, 'My sons have become powerful on earth. If Yudhisthira performs the Rajasuya, I will be transferred to Indraloka, and also his fame will be spread far and wide.' This is the desire of your father. With your four brothers to help you and with Lord Krishna on your side, it will be possible for you to perform the Rajasuya. However, you must first conquer all the earthly kings. It is not an easy task, but I know you are capable of it. Reflecting on this, do as you think fit. I will go to Dvaraka City and request Lord Krishna to help you."" Narada then left Indraprastha and ascended into the heavens, constantly chanting the glories of Lord Krishna."
21,Sabha Parva,King Yudhisthira Prepares for a Rajasuya Sacrifice,"King Yudhisthira, having heard the advice of Narada, sighed heavily and engaged his thoughts in the matter of the Rajasuya sacrifice. He assembled his counsellors and ministers in the imperial court and worshiped them accordingly. They also venerated him in return. They then began to discuss preparations for the Rajasuya sacrifice. King Yudhisthira wanted to determine the ultimate good for all his citizens and not simply for his own personal glorification. That foremost of all virtuous men was always kind to his subjects and worked for the welfare of all without making distinctions. Being devoid of arrogance and anger, King Yudhisthira always said, ""Give unto each his due."" The citizens responded to such righteousness with the sounds, ""Blessed be Dharma (Yudhisthira)! Blessed be Dharma!""
Receiving paternal assurance from Maharaja Yudhisthira, the citizens in his kingdom never harbored ever the the slightest hostile feeling towards him. He therefore came to be known as Ajatrashatru (one with no enemy at all). The king cherished every citizen in his state as a personal family member.
Bhima, also, governed the citizens justly. Arjuna, the carrier of the Gandiva bow, protected everyone from any external enemies. The wise Sahadeva administered justice impartially, and Nakula behaved towards all with a humility that was inherant in him. Owing to the natural good qualities of the Pandavas, the kingdom became free from disputes and fear of any kind. The citizens were attentive to their respective occupations and there was no such thing as unemployment. In King Yudhisthira's kingdom every one joyfully executed his occupational duties. The rain became so abundant that the fields produced more than their usual amount. The kingdom of the Pandavas grew in prosperity.
In consequence of the King's virtues, the money lenders, the cowherdsmen, the farmers and the traders grew in prosperity. During the reign of King Yudhisthira, whoever was devoted to truth, never experienced extortion, recession, fear of disease, fire, or death by poisoning or incantations. It was never heard at any time that thieves or royal favorites ever behaved inimically toward the King or towards one another. In other words, there was no crime in Maharaja Yudhisthira's domain.
Kings from other countries were always desiring to serve King Yudhisthira in order to please and worship him. The merchants of different classes were always happy to bring their taxes levied on their respective occupations. Whatever countries King Yudhisthira conquered, the citizens, from brahmanas to shudras, became more attached to him than to their own fathers and mothers.
After assembling his ministers and brothers, King Yudhisthira repeatedly questioned them about the possibility of performing the Rajasuya sacrifice. The ministers, as a body, then responded to the King, ""O prince of the Kuru race, all in this assembly have concluded that you are worthy of the attributes of an emperor. Therefore, the time for you to perform the auspicious Rajasuya sacrifice in now. The time for that sacrifice, in which ascetic rishis kindle the six fires with mantras from the Sama Veda, has come for you in consequence of your kingly possessions. At the conclusion of the Rajasuya sacrifice, when the performer is installed as the world sovereign, he is rewarded the fruits of all other sacrifices, including the agnihotra. You are quite able, O noble King, to perform this sacrifice. Therefore, make your resolution to perform the Rajasuya without any further discussion.""
King Yudhisthira, that foremost emperor, having heard the decision of his ministers agreed mentally. However, he again consulted with his brothers, the brahmanas, with Dhaumya, Dwaipayana and others. He wanted to be sure that this was not his own personal desire, but the desire of the Supreme. The King possessed great wisdom and had subjugated his mind and senses. He took everything into consideration including his own strength and means, the circumstances of time and place and his income and expenditure. He knew that the wise never grieve after giving full thoughtfulness to all points.
Thinking that the sacrifice should not commence only on his desire, the pious King Yudhisthira thought Lord Krishna to be the proper person to make the final decision. He knew Lord Krishna possessed infinite prowess and wisdom. He knew also that the Lord was birthless although apparently taking birth. Reflecting on the Godly qualities of Lord Krishna, Maharaja Yudhisthira concluded that there was nothing unknown to Him. Maharaja Yudhisthira, therefore, humbly requested Narada to go to Dvaraka to convey his desires to Lord Krishna.
Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, lived in the city of Dvaraka along with his sixteen thousand one hundred and eight queens. He built a separate palace for each and every one of them, and each queen thought that Krishna was living with her alone. The Lord would perform certain morning duties, and after He had completed them, He would leave His palaces and go to the Sudharma imperial court. His charioteer Daruka would come with the Lord's chariot, bow down before the Lord, and stand with folded hands, intimating that the chariot was ready. Holding on to His charioteer's hands, Lord Krishna would mount the chariot, together with Uddhava and Satyaki. While sitting on the dazzling chariot, Lord Krishna appeared more beautiful than the sun rising on the Eastern horizon. When the Lord was about to leave His palaces, all the queens and palace ladies would look at Him with shy, loving glances. The Lord would respond in a loving way, making separation very difficult. He attracted their hearts so much so that they could not forget Him for a moment during their daily activities. The Lord would say good-bye in all the sixteen thousand palaces, and again He would become one and enter the Sudharma Imperial court in procession with other members of the Yadu dynasty.
Then Lord Krishna, attended by all the Vrishnis, would enter the Imperial Royal court named Sudharma. The Sudharma Imperial Court had been taken away from the heavenly planets and reestablished in Dvaraka City. The uniqueness of the Royal Court was that anyone who entered it would be freed from the six kinds of material waves, namely hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, old age and death. As long as one remained in that imperial court of Sudharma, he would not be infected by these six material pangs.
After entering the imperial assembly house, Lord Krishna sat on the exalted royal throne, emanating a radiant aura of transcendental effulgence. In the midst of all the famed heroes of the Yadu dynasty, Lord Krishna resembled the full moon, surrounded by the multitude of luminious stars. In the imperial court professional jesters would enterain the Lord by displaying various comic moods. The jesters would joke in such a way that the Lord and His associates would laugh heartedly, refreshing the morning mood. One by one actors, female dancers and musicians would begin their respective functions to please the Lord and put Him in a happy mood. The dramatic actors would relive the lives of great kings and incarnations of the Lord, and the dancing girls would separately display their artistic movements. These performers would dance and sing to the sounds of mridangas (drum), vinas (stringed instrument), flutes, symbols and conchshells followed by the sound of the murajas, another type of drum.
Along with the melodic sounds of the instuments, the professional poets (sutas) chroniclers (magadhas) and panegyrists (vandinahs) would recite the Lord's glories. In the imperial court highly pious brahmanas were heard fluently and devotionally chanting the Vedic hymns, while other brahmanas narrated histories of past kings of pious renown. In this way, the residents of Dvaraka City would offer their respective services to the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to please Him. The Lord, accompanied by the other members of the Yadu dynasty, would be very much pleased to accept the loving devotion of His eternal associates.
Once, while this festive mood was in progress, a man arrived at the door of the imperial court, and with the permission of Lord Krishna, he was admitted into the assembly by the doorkeeper. The man bowed down to the Lord and then stood before Him with joined palms. With the permission of the Lord he then began to describe how King Jarasandha conquered all other kingdoms and how many kings did not accept subjugation before Jarasandha. As a result of their refusal, all of them, numbering twenty thousand, were arrested and incarcerated. This man was a messenger from these imprisoned kings, and he now presented their pleas before Lord Krishna , ""O Krishna, Krishna, O inconceivable Soul, O destroyer of all fear for Your surrendered devotees, despite our unsurrendered mentality, we have come to You for shelter out of fear of material existence. People in this world are always diverted by sinful activities and are thus bewildered about their real duty, which is to worship You according to Your will. Devotional service to You is the only activity that would truly bring them good fortune. Let us offer our obeisances unto You, the all-powerful Lord, who appears as eternal time and frustrates one's stubborn hope for a long life in this world. You are the predominating Lord of the universe and have descended into this world with Your personal potency to protect the saintly devotees and annhilate the wicked. We cannot understand, O Lord, how anyone can transgress Your supreme will and still continue to enjoy his fruitive work.
""O Lord, we are encaged in these material bodies, and are thus always full of fear. We bear the burden of the illusory happiness of kings, which is just like a dream. Thus we have rejected the inner happiness of the soul, which comes by rendering unmotivated and selfless devotional service to You. Because of our wretched attachments, we simply suffer in this life under the enchantment of Your deluding energy. Therefore, since Your lotus feet relieve the material affliction of those who surrender to You, please release us from the shackles of our past sinful activities, which have now manifested in the form of the Magadha King, Jarasandha. Wielding alone the prowess of ten thousand maddened elephants, he has arrested us and locked us in his prison just as a lion captures sheep.
""O wielder to the disc! Your strength is unlimited and beyond human comparison, and thus seventeen times You crushed Jarasandha in battle. But then, absorbed in Your own pastimes, he appeared to defeat You once. Now he is so filled with pride that he thinks he can harass those who are Your devoted followers. O unconquerable Lord, You have descended to protect the pious and to annihilate those opposed to Your supreme will. Please fulfill Your mission by killing this Jarasandha.""
""This is the appeal of the kings imprisoned by Jarasandha,"" the envoy continued. ""They are aspiring for Your personal association, having surrendered to Your lotus feet. Please shower your grace and causeless mercy upon these afflicted souls.""
After the representative of the imprisoned kings had thus spoken, Narada rishi, the sage amongst the demigods, suddenly appeared in that assembly. Bearing golden matted locks on his head and emanating a cooling effulgent aura, the sage entered the imperial court like the radiant solar orb. Lord Krishna is the worshipable deity for even planetary rulers like Brahma, Shiva, Indra, Surya, Chandra, Varuna and others, yet as soon as He saw Narada Muni, He humbly and joyfully stood up along with the other members of the Yadu dynasty to receive the powerful sage. To set an example of how to receive a saintly person, He then offered His respectful obeisances by bowing His head.
Knowing that Lord Krishna was setting an example for the kingly order, Narada accepted the seat offered to him. Lord Krishna worshiped the sage with full paraphernalia according to scriptural injunctions and gratified him with reverence. He then spoke the following truthful and pleasing words, ""It is certain that to the entire universe, and certainly our small assembly, has attained freedom from all fear, for such is the influence of a great personality like yourself. There is nothing unknown to you within the cosmic manifestation of the Supreme Lord. Certainly you have visited Indraprastha and the Pandavas headed by King Yudhisthira. Therefore please tell Us how the Pandavas are faring and what plans they intend to execute for the welfare of the entire world.""
""I have many times seen,"" Narada replied, ""the insurmountable power of Your illusory energy, O infallible one. With this power You bewilder even the creator of this universe, Brahma. O Lord of infinite prowess, it does not surprise me that You disguise Yourself as an ordinary human being by Your own diverse energies while moving among the created beings, as fire covers its luster with smoke. Who can understand properly Your purpose? Simply by Your desire this material energy creates and also withdraws the cosmos, and the interim manifestation appears to have substantial existence. Obeisances to you, whose transcendental position is inconceivable. The conditioned soul bound by the repetition of birth and death does not know how to free himself the material tabernacle, which is the cause of his affliction. But You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, descend to this world in various incarnations to teach and illumine the soul's path back to the spiritual sky. Your glorious pastimes triumphantly dominate this universe and are the only panacea for the conditioned soul. Therefore, I surrender unto You.
""Nonetheless, O Supreme Truth, who plays the part of a human being, I shall relate to You what Your devotee Maharaja Yudhisthira, the son of Your Aunt Kunti, intends to do. Desiring unrivaled sovereignty, King Yudhisthira plans to worship You with the greatest fire sacrifice, the Rajasuya. First of all may I inform You that King Yudhisthira has all material opulences which are possible to achieve in the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka. He has no material opulence for which to aspire, and yet he wants to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice only to get Your association and please You. Please bless his endeavor with Your personal presence. O Lord, exalted heavenly Gods and glorious kings, eager to see you, will all come to that best of sacrifices. O Lord, even mllechas and yavanas are purified by hearing and chanting Your glories and meditating upon You, the Absolute Truth. What then to speak of those who see and touch You?
""My dear Lord, You are the symbol of everything auspicious. Your transcendental name and fame is spread throughout the universe like an umbrella, gving a chance to the conditioned souls to revive their original nature as Your eternal servant. The transcendental water that washes Your lotus feet is known in the higher planetary systems as the Mandakini River, in the lower planetary systems as the Bhogavati and in this earthly planetary system as the Ganges. This sacred water flows throughout the entire universe, purifying wherever it goes.""
Previous to Narada's arrival, the Yadus had been listening to the messenger from the imprisoned kings, and they were contemplating how to conquer Jarasandha. Therefore, they objected to the proposal of Narada out of a desire to subjugate the Magadha King. Seeing the differences of opinion, Lord Keshava turned to his servant Uddhava and smilingly requested him in the following words, ""My dear Uddhava, you are always my well-wishing confidential friend, and because you possess the eye of wisdom, I wish to see everything through you because I believe that your counsel is always right. Therefore please advise us what should be done in this situation.""
It was known to Uddhava that although Lord Krishna was acting like an ordinary man, He knew everything - past, present and future. However, because the Lord was trying to consult with him, Uddhava, in order to render service to the Lord, began to speak."
22,Sabha Parva,Lord Krishna journeys to Indraprastha City,"Having heard the statements of Devarshi Narada, and understanding the opinions of both the assembly and Lord Krishna, the highly intelligent Uddhava began to speak, ""O Lord, as the rishi advised, You should help Your cousin Yudhisthira fulfill his plan for performing the Rajasuya sacrifice, and You should also protect the kings who are begging for Your shelter. Only one who has conquered all opponents in every direction can perform the Rajasuya sacrifice, O almighty one. Thus, in my opinion, conquering Jarasandha will serve both purposes. By this decision the Rajasuya sacrifice will be performed, and You will save the imprisoned kings. Thus, Govinda, You will be glorified.
""The invincible King Jarasandha"" Uddhava continued, ""is as strong as ten thousand elephants. Indeed, other powerful warriors cannot defeat him. Only Bhima is equal to him in strength. He will be defeated by an equal opponent in duel, not when he is leading his hundred military divisions. Now, Jarasandha is so devoted to brahminical culture that he never refuses requests from brahmanas. Bhima should go to him disguised as a brahmana and beg charity. Thus he will obtain single combat with Jarasandha, and in Your presence Bhima will no doubt kill him. Even Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva act only as Your instruments in cosmic creation and annihilation, which are ultimately done by You, the Supreme Lord, in Your invisible aspect of time.
""In their homes, the wives of the imprisoned kings sing of Your noble deeds-about how you will kill Jarasandha and deliver them. The gopis also sing Your glories--how You killed the crocodile enemy of Gajendra, the elephant king; Ravana, the enemy of Sita; and the enemies of Your own parents as well. So also do the sages who have obtained Your shelter glorify You, as do we ourselves. O Krishna, the killing of Jarasandha, which is certainly a reaction of his past sins, will bring immense benefit. Indeed, it will make possible the execution of the Rajasuya ceremony as You desire.""
Devarshi Narada, the Yadu elders, the ministers and Lord Krishna all welcomed Uddhava's proposal, which was entirely auspicious and full of wisdom. Thereafter, Lord Shree Krishna, the chief of the Yadus, honored Narada Muni. After bowing down to the Lord, Devarshi Narada's senses were fully satisfied. Thus having heard the decision of the Lord and having been worshiped by Him, Narada placed the Lord firmly within his heart and graceful departed into the clear blue sky.
With pleasing words the Lord, who has eyes like lotus petals, addressed the messenger sent by the kings, ""My dear messenger, I wish all good fortune to you, I shall arrange for the killing of King Magadha. Do not fear."" Feeling satisfied at heart, the messenger departed and relayed the Lord's message to the imprisoned kings. Eager for freedom, they then waited anxiously for their meeting with the Lord of all sentient beings.
The almighty personality of Godhead, the son of Devaki, begged His superiors for permission to leave. Then He ordered His servants, headed by Daruka and Jaitra, to prepare for departure. Arrangements were made for His 16,108 queens, their children and baggage to be taken to Indraprastha. After taking leave of Lord Baladeva and King Ugrasena, Lord Krishna mounted His chariot marked with the insignia of Garuda and departed for Indraprastha. The vibrations of mridangas, bheris, kettledrums, conchshells and gomukhas filled the sky in all directions as the Lord set out on His journey. He was accompanied by the commanders of His chariot, elephant, calvary and infantry divisions. He was also surrounded on all sides by His personal body guards. Lord Achyuta's chaste wives, along with their children, followed the Lord on golden palanquins carried by stout armed men. The queens were adorned with fine clothing, ornaments, fragrant oils and flower garlands, and they were surrounded on all sides by soldiers carrying swords and shields.
On all sides of the procession were finely adorned women--attendants of the royal household, as well as courtesans. They rode on palanquins and camels, bulls and buffalo, donkeys, mules, bullock carts and elephants. Their conveyances were fully loaded with tents, blankets, clothes and other items for the trip. Lord Krishna's imperial procession was adorned with royal umbrellas, chamara fans and huge flagpoles with waving banners. During the  the sun's rays reflected brightly from the soldiers' finely polished weapons, jewelry, helmets and armor. Thus Lord Krishna's army, exuberant with shouts and clatter, appeared like an ocean stirring with agitated waves and timingila fish. The royal procession could be seen from one horizon to the other, so great was the number of men, women, animals and paraphernalia.
As He traveled through the provinces of Anarta, Sauvira, Marudesha and Vinashana, Lord Hari crossed rivers and passed mountains, cities, villages, cow pastures and stone quarries. The inhabitants of these regions perfected their eyesight by gazing on the transcendental features of the Lord. They waved their upper clothes and glorified the transcendental activities of the Lord. After crossing the rivers Drishadvati and Sarasvati, He passed through Panchala and Matsya and finally came to Indraprastha.
King Yudhisthira was delighted to hear that the Lord, whom ordinary citizens rarely see, had now arrived. Accompanied by his priests and dear associates, the King came out to meet Lord Krishna. As songs and musical instruments resounded along with the loud vibration of Vedic hymns, the King went forth with great reverence to meet Lord Hrishikesha, just as the senses go forth to meet the consciousness of life. The heart of King Yudhisthira melted with affection when he saw his dearmost friend, Lord Krishna, after such a long separation, and he embraced the Lord again and again. The eternal form of Lord Krishna is the everlasting residence of the goddess of fortune. As soon as King Yudhisthira embraced Him the King became free of all the contamination of material existence. He immediately felt transcendental bliss and merged in an ocean of jubilation. There were tears in his eyes, and his body trembled due to ecstasy. He completely forgot that he was living in this world. Then Bhima, his eyes brimming with affectionate tears, laughed with joy as he embraced his maternal cousin, Krishna. Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva also joyfully embraced their dearmost friend, the infallible Lord and tears of love fell profusely from their eyes.
After Arjuna had embraced Him once more and Nakula and Sahadeva had offered Him their obeisances, Lord Krishna bowed down to the brahmanas and elders present, thus properly honoring the respectable members of the Kuru, Shrinjaya and Kaikaya dynasties. Sutas, Magadhas, Gandharvas, Vandis, jesters and brahmanas all glorified the lotus-eyed Lord--some reciting prayers, some dancing and singing--as mridangas, conchshells, kettledrums, vinas, panavas and gomukhas resounded. Thus surrounded by His well-wishing relatives and praised on all sides, Lord Krishna, the crest jewel of the justly renowned, entered the decorated city.
The roads of Indraprastha were sprayed with fragrant water sprinkled from the trunks of intoxicated elephants, and colorful flags, golden gateways and full waterpots enhanced the city's splendor. Men and young girls were beautifully arrayed in fine, new garments, adorned with flower garlands and ornaments, and anointed with aromatic sandalwood paste. Every home displayed glowing lamps and respectful offerings, and from the holes of the latticed windows drifted incense, further beautifying the city. Colorful banners waved in the breeze, and the roofs were a series of finely carved golden domes situated on broad silver bases. Thus Lord Krishna saw the royal city of the Kuru King, Maharaja Yudhisthira.
When the young women of Indraprastha heard that Lord Krishna, the reservoir of pleasure for every eye, had arrived, they hurriedly went onto the royal streets to see Him. They abandoned their household duties and even left their husbands in bed, and in their eagerness, the knots of their hair and garments came loose. The royal streets being quite crowded with elephants, horses, chariots and foot soldiers, the women climbed to the top of their houses, where they caught sight of Lord Krishna and His queens. The city ladies scattered flowers upon the Lord, embraced him in their minds and expressed their heartfelt welcome with broadly smiling faces. Observing Lord Mukunda's wives passing on the well paved and ornately designed streets like stars accompanying the moon, the women exclaimed, ""What pious activities and austerities have these ladies executed that grant them the joy of Lord Keshava's generous smiles and playful sidelong glances?""
Along the well decorated avenues of Indraprastha, citizens came forward holding auspicious offerings for Lord Krishna, and sinless leaders of occupational guilds came forward to worship the Lord. With wide-open eyes, the members of the royal household rushed forward in a flurry to lovingly greet Lord Mukunda, and thus the Lord entered the royal palace of King Yudhisthira. When Queen Kunti saw her nephew Krishna, the master of the three worlds, her heart filled with loving devotion. Rising from her couch with her daughter-in-law, Draupadi, Kunti embraced the Lord and all feelings of anxiety disappeared from her heart. King Yudhisthira respectfully brought Lord Govinda, the Supreme God of gods, to his personal quarters. The King was so overcome with joy that he could not remember all the rituals of worship.
Encouraged by Queen Kunti, Draupadi worshiped all of Lord Krishna's wives, including Rukmini, Satyabhama, Bhadra, Jambavati, Kalindi, Mitravinda, Nagnajiti, Lakshmana and the other queens of Lord Krishna who were present. Draupadi honored all of them with such gifts as clothing, flower garlands and jewelry. King Yudhisthira personally made arrangements for Krishna's comfort and saw to it that all who came along with Him--namely His queens, soldiers, ministers and secretaries--were comfortably situated. He arranged that they would experience a new feature of reception every  while staying as guests of the Pandavas."
23,Sabha Parva,King Jarasandha Slain,"In the great assembly of respectable persons, citizens, friends, relatives, brahmanas, kshatriyas and vaishyas, King Yudhisthira, in the presence of all, including his brothers, directly addressed Lord Krishna as follows, ""O Krishna, I desire to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. That sacrifice, however, cannot be performed without the sanction of higher authorities. You know, O Krishna, everything about the means by which this sacrifice may be accomplished. That person alone can perfect this sacrifice in whom everything is possible, who is worshiped everywhere and who is the king of kings. My friends and counsellors have said that I should perform that sacrifice. However, My Lord, I desire to worship Your auspicious, opulent expansions by the Rajasuya sacrifice, the king of Vedic ceremonies. Please make our endeavor a success, my Lord. Purified persons who constantly serve, meditate upon and glorify Your shoes, which destroy everything inauspicious, are sure to obtain freedom from material existence, O lotus-naveled one. Even if they desire something in this world, they obtain it, whereas others-those who do not take shelter of You-are never satisfied, O Lord. Therefore, O Lord of lords, let the people of this world see the power of devotional service rendered to Your lotus feet. Please show them, O almighty one, the position of those Kurus and Shrinjayas who worship You, and the position of those who do not. Within Your mind there can be no such differentiation as ""This one is mine, and that is another's,"" because You are the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Soul of all beings, always equipoised and enjoying transcendental happiness within Yourself. Just like the heavenly desire tree, You bless all who properly worship You, granting their desired fruits in proportion to the service they render You. There is nothing wrong in this.
""My dear Govinda, as far as the execution of this sacrifice is concerned, Your words of wisdom shall be my guide. Those who give me counsel, out of friendship, do not know the difficulties that are to be encountered. Others, from motives of self interest, say only what is agreeable. Men are seen to counsel according to their motivations. However, You, O Krishna, are above material motivation. You are Hrishikesha, the controller of desire and anger. It behoves You to tell me what will most benefit the world.""
""O great king,"" Lord Krishna replied, ""your decision is perfect, and thus your noble fame will spread to all the worlds, O tormentor of the foes. Indeed, for the benefit of the great sages, the forefathers and the heavenly gods, for Our well-wishing friends and, indeed, for all living beings, the performance of this king of Vedic sacrifices is desirable. First conquer all kings, bring the earth under your control and collect all the required paraphernalia; then execute this great sacrifice. These brothers of yours, O king, have taken birth as partial expansions of the various ruling heavenly gods. And you are so self controlled that you have conquered even Me, who am unconquerable for those who cannot control their senses. No one in this world, even a demigod--what to speak of an earthly king--can defeat My devotee with his strength, beauty, fame or riches.
""My dear King, you possess the proper qualifications essential to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. However, there is one impediment of which you must be informed. The numerous royal lines all represent themselves as descendants of Aila and Ikshvaku. These descendants are divided into a hundred separate dynasties. In this line the descendants of Yayati and Bhoja and numerous. At the present, O monarch, King Jarasandha, has subjugated many of these kshatriyas and incarcerated them. Jarasandha is now enjoying sovereignty over the middle portion of the earth. He has resolved to create disunion among the different dynasties.
""O Monarch, only a King who is the king of all kings can properly be called an emperor. Many Kings and princes have voluntarily taken his shelter. They include Shishupala, the mighty Vaka, who waits upon Jarasandha as his disciple. There is also Hansa, Dimvaka, Dantavakra, Karusha, Karava, and Meghavahana. King Bhagadatta, who is the old friend of your father, has bowed his head before Jarasandha. In his heart he has affection for you, but he regards you as a father regards his son, and not as a subordinate king looks upon an emperor. Paundraka, who represents himself as a divine personality and falsely bears My symbols of the conch, disc, lotus and mace, has also espoused the side of Jarasandha. Even King Bhishmaka, My father-in-law, has become a servitor of Jarasandha. Eighteen clans of the Bhojas have fled to the west out of fear of Jarasandha. So have the Surasenas, the Bhadrakas, the Vodhas, the Salwas, the Patachcharas, the Susthalas, the Kukuttas, the Kulindas, along with the Kuntis and many others have also fled their countries alarmed at the power of Jarasandha. The King of Magadha has conquered many lands and has imprisoned eighty-six kings. When the total of kings incarcerated reaches one hundred, he will sacrifice these noblemen before his deity, Lord Shiva. O King, before the Rajasuya sacrifice can be performed, Jarasandha must by slain and the imprisoned Kings released. Only then can one be truly called an emperor, one who rules over all other kings.""
""O Janardana,"" Yudhisthira said, ""we have also been frightened by the wickedness of this monarch. O infallible one, the might of Your arms is our refuge and strength. I am repeatedly depressed at the thought that Jarasandha cannot be slain. But what shall I say, O Keshava? You are my highest authority on everything. Please tell me, O Krishna, the history of this Jarasandha, his birth and how he obtained so much power. How is it that although You have conquered him eighteen times, he is still living?""
Lord Krishna replied, ""Hear, O Monarch, the history behind this Jarasandha and his great power. There was a mighty King of the Magadhas named Brihadratha. He owned three Akshauhini divisions of troops and was very puffed up over his strength. He had married the two daughters of the King of Kashi. Many years passed, however, without obtaining a son.
""One  he went to the great sage named Chandra Kausika and served the rishi with great care. The sage became pleased with him and asked him to take a benediction. King Brihadratha then asked for a son who could continue his dynasty. While they were talking, a mango dropped from the tree into the muni's lap. The muni then said to the King, ""Your desire shall be fulfilled."" He then chanted mantras and handed over that mango to the King telling him to give half to each queen. The muni then went away. King Brihadratha cut the fruit in half and gave each queen a portion. In due course of time the queens became pregnant. The King was overjoyed and waited for the birth of the children.
""It so happened that both queens gave birth to fragmental children. A half of a child took birth from each of them. The queens were disgusted and arranged that the king throw the portions of the children in the forest. After this had been accomplished, a witch named Jara happened to come to the spot where the two halves were thrown. She loved human flesh and desired to take the newly found meal home with her. To make it easier to carry the halves, she joined them, and when she did, the two halves united and became one child. She was unable to carry the child because of its great weight. The child began to roar like a monsoon cloud, and she could not stop it. It so happened that the King was in the area, and hearing the crying of the child, he came to that spot. The Rakshasa woman then informed the monarch, 'O Brihadratha, here is your child that has been cast into the forest. I have found the child in two parts and, joining them, the child has become one. I have been living in your kingdom, and I am pleased with your rule. Take this child back for he is destined to become King.' The Rakshasa woman then gave the child to the King and disappeared from sight. Because the child was brought to life by this she-witch, he was given the name Jarasandha, which means one who was joined by the witch Jara.""
Lord Krishna continued: ""The child grew up to be as powerful as ten thousand elephants. When King Brihadratha saw the power and influence of his son, he crowned his son king and then entered the forest to perform austerities and penances. Jarasandha offered his two daughters, Asti and Prapti, to King Kamsa of Mathura. When I killed King Kamsa, I created an enmity with the powerful Jarasandha. Overcome with anger, Jarasandha took up his mace and released it a distance of ninety-nine yojanas (792 miles). It landed just outside the city of Mathura. Understanding his intentions, we prepared the city of Mathura for attack. We defeated him eighteen times, but still he persisted in fighting. On his eighteenth attempt, I was already engaged in obtaining Rukmini for My wife. I, therefore, ordered the city of Dvaraka built so that no other powerful kings could attack the Yadu dynasty while I was away. The time has now come for his death.""
Upon hearing these nectarean words from the lotus mouth of the Supreme Lord, King Yudhisthira became joyful, and his face blossomed like a lotus. Lord Krishna then informed King Yudhisthira of the plan explained by Uddhava for conquering King Jarasandha. Bhimasena, Arjuna and Lord Krishna then started together for Girivraja, the capital city of Jarasandha. Attired in the dress of brahmanas, they looked wonderful and radiant. When the people saw them walking on the road, they regarded Jarasandha as already slain.
Upon reaching the region of Magadha, Lord Krishna exclaimed, ""Behold, O Partha, the great capital of Girivraja, standing in all its splendor. Just see outside the city walls the vast ocean of cows and sheep. This majestic town has a water source that is inexhaustible. Just see the fine mansions symmetrically aligned. Indeed, it appears that this city is free from any kind of calamity. Just behold the five large hills that surround the city. They are covered with cooling shade trees, bearing flowers of every scent and color. It was here that the great sage Gautama had his ashrama for some time. Due to his presence, this place has become almost a heavenly abode. Even Manu has ordered that the land of Magadha never be afflicted with drought. Owning such a city, Jarasandha desires to become the emperor of the entire earth. We shall, however, humble his pride by slaying him in single combat.""
Before entering the city, Bhima and Arjuna decided to pulverize Chaityaka peak near the city gate. This hill was one of the five that surrounded the city and it was dear to the inhabitants and also to King Jarasandha. On this hill King Brihadratha had once slain a cannibal named Rishava and made three drums from the Rakshasa's skin. When those drums were beaten, the reverberating sound echoed for one full month. With their mighty arms only, Bhima and Arjuna leveled the hill to the point where the drums were beaten, indicating their desire to place their feet on the head of their foe. With the power of their arms they broke down the peak, which was worshipped by the citizens of Girivraja.
Lord Krishna, Bhima and Arjuna then joyfully entered Girivraja in the guise of brahmanas. As they walked down the main road, they beheld the extraordinary arrangement of shops full of various edibles, hand crafted items and floral wreaths. Some of the shops were supplied with intricately carved articles of various qualities that any person might desire. The shop owners and other citizens of Magadha, beholding those heroes looking like elephants, with broad necks and chests, began to wonder about them. Lord Krishna, Bhima and Arjuna then chose garlands from the shop of one fortunate flower merchant and decorated their bodies with them. Their arms, which were broad like the trunks of trees, were then smeared with sandalwood paste by one merchant who pious activities had now fully fructified. Attired in robes of various colors and decked in garlands and earrings, the heroes approached King Jarasandha's palace. Those bulls among men passed through three gates that were heavily guarded with soldiers and men. They cheerfully entered the palace of King Jarasandha, and the King, seeing these extraordinary personalities approaching, exclaimed, ""You are welcome in my kingdom."" He rose to offer them proper sitting places. He washed their feet with honey and water, and offered them gifts of cows and wealth.
Partha and Bhima remained silent during the reception. Therefore, Lord Krishna informed King Jarasandha, ""O monarch, these two brahmanas are in observance of a vow. Therefore, they will not speak until midnight when their vow will be completed. You may talk with them at that time."" King Jarasandha then gave his guests comfortable quarters and retired to his own chambers.
King Jarasandha was famous for honoring brahmanas. Even if a brahmana requested an audience at midnight, he would grant it. Therefore, he rose at midnight and approached the quarters of his guests. Despite the strange attire of these brahmanas, he waited on them respectfully. He asked them to take their seats and then inquired from them, ""It is well known to me that brahmanas observing vows of silence never attire themselves with garlands, and fragrant paste. Who are you? You are dressed as brahmanas, but your arms bear the marks of bowstrings. You lead me to believe that you are brahmanas, but you exude kshatriya energy. Tell me truly who you are. You have broken the peak of Chaityaka hill, and you have entered my city without fear of royal wrath. The quality of a brahmana dwells in his speech and not in his physical prowess. This destruction of Chaityaka hill is not suited to the order you profess. What is your motive for coming to me?""
Lord Krishna, in the dress of a brahmana, replied to the King: ""O King, know us to be needy guests who have come to you from afar. We wish all good fortune to you. Please grant us whatever we desire. What can the tolerant not bear? What will the wicked not do? What will the generous not give in charity? And who will those with equal vision see as an outsider? He, indeed, is to be censured and pitied who, though able to do so, fails to achieve with his temporary body the lasting fame glorified by great saints. Harischandra, Rantideva, Unchavritti Mudgala, Bali, Shibi, the legendary hunter and pigeon, and many others have attained the permanent by means of the impermanent."" Lord Krishna, in the garb of a brahmana, thus informed Jarasandha that fame is imperishable, but the body is perishable. If one can attain imperishable name and fame by sacrificing his perishable body, he becomes a very respectable figure in the history of human civilization.
While Lord Krishna was speaking in the garb of a brahmana, Jarasandha became convinced that the three of them were not actual brahmanas. The signs on their bodies indicated that they were kshatriyas. Their shoulders were marked with an impression due to carrying bows; they had beautiful bodily structure, and their voices were grave and commanding. Thus he definitely concluded that they were not brahmanas, but kshatriyas. He was also thinking that he had seen them somewhere before. Although these three persons were kshatriyas, they had come to his door begging alms like brahmanas. Therefore, he decided that he would fulfill their desires, in spite of their being kshatriyas. He thought in this way because their position had already been diminished by their appearing before him as beggars.
""Under the circumstances,"" he thought, ""I am prepared to give them anything. Even if they ask for my body, I shall not hesitate to offer it to them."" In this regard, he began to think of Bali Maharaja. Lord Vishnu in the dress of a brahmana appeared as a beggar before Bali, and in that way He snatched away all of his opulence and kingdom. He did this for the benefit of Indra, who, having been defeated by Bali Maharaja, was bereft of his kingdom. Although Bali Maharaja was cheated, his reputation as a great devotee who was able to give anything and everything in charity is still glorified throughout the three worlds. Bali Maharaja could guess that the brahmana was Lord Vishnu Himself and that He had come to him just to take away his opulent kingdom on behalf of Indra. Bali's spiritual master and family priest, Sukracharya, repeatedly warned him about this, and yet Bali did not hesitate to give in charity whatever the brahmana wanted, and at last he gave up everything to that brahmana.
""It is my strong determination,"" thought Jarasandha, ""that if I can achieve immortal reputation by sacrificing this perishable body, I must act for that purpose; the life of a kshatriya who does not live for the benefit of the brahmana is certainly condemned.""
Actually King Jarasandha was very liberal in giving charity to the brahmanas, and thus he informed Lord Krishna, Bhima and Arjuna, ""My dear brahmanas, you can ask from me whatever you like. If you so desire, you can take my head also. I am prepared to give it.""
After this, Lord Krishna addressed Jarasandha as follows: ""My dear King, please note that we are not actually brahmanas, nor have we come to ask for foodstuffs or grains. We are all kshatriyas, and we have come to beg a duel with you. We hope that you will agree to this proposal. You may note that here is the second son of King Pandu, Bhimasena, and the third son of Pandu, Arjuna. As for Myself, you may know that I am your old enemy Krishna, the cousin of the Pandavas.""
When Lord Krishna disclosed their disguise, King Jarasandha began to laugh very loudly, and then in great anger and in a grave voice he exclaimed, ""You fools! If you want to fight with me, I immediately grant your request. But, Krishna, I know that You are a coward. I will not fight with You because You refused to face me in fighting and have left the battlefield. Out of fear of me You left Your own city, Mathura, and now You have taken shelter within the sea; therefore, I must refuse to fight with You. As far as Arjuna is concerned, I know that he is younger than I and is not an equal fighter. I refuse to fight with him because he is not in any way an equal competitor. But as far as Bhimasena is concerned, I think he is a suitable competitor to fight with me."" After speaking in this way, King Jarasandha immediately handed a very heavy club to Bhimasena, and he himself took another, and thus all of them went outside the city walls to fight.
Bhimasena and King Jarasandha engaged themselves in fighting, and with their respective clubs, which were as strong as thunderbolts, they began to strike one another very severely, both of them being eager to fight. They were both expert fighters with clubs, and their techniques of striking one another were so beautiful that they appeared to be two dramatic artists dancing on a stage. The citizens of Magadha, consisting of thousands of brahmanas, kshatriyas, vaishyas, shudras, women and the aged, all came out of the city to witness the combat. The crowd became so great that there was a solid mass of humanity with no space between bodies.
When the clubs of Jarasandha and Bhimasena loudly collided, they sounded like the impact of the big tusks of two fighting elephants, or like a thunderbolt in a flashing electrical storm. When two elephants fight together in a sugarcane field, each of them snatches a stick of sugarcane and, by catching it tightly in its trunk, strikes the other. Each elephant heavily strikes his enemy's shoulders, arms, collarbones, chest, thighs, waist, and legs, and in this way the sticks of sugarcane are smashed. Similarly, all the clubs used by Jarasandha and Bhimasena were broken, and so the enemies prepared to fight with their strong-fisted hands. Both Jarasandha and Bhimasena were very angry, and they began to smash each other with their fists. The striking of their fists sounded like the striking of iron bars or like the sound of thunderbolts, and they appeared to be like two elephants fighting. Unfortunately, however, neither was able to defeat the other because both were very expert in fighting, both were of equal strength, and their fighting techniques were equal also. Neither Jarasandha nor Bhimasena became fatigued or defeated in the fighting, although they struck each other continually. At the end of a 's fighting, both lived at night as friends in Jarasandha's palace, and the next  they fought again. In this way they passed twenty-seven s in fighting.
On the twenty-eighth , Bhimasena told Krishna, ""My dear Krishna, I must frankly admit that I cannot conquer Jarasandha."" Lord Krishna, however, knew the mystery of the birth of Jarasandha. Jarasandha was born in two different parts from two different mothers. When his father saw that the baby was useless, he threw the two parts in the forest, where they were later found by a black-hearted witch named Jara. She managed to join the two parts of the body of the baby from top to bottom. Knowing this, Lord Krishna, therefore, also knew how to kill him. He gave hints to Bhimasena that since Jarasandha was brought to life by the joining of the two parts of his body, he could be killed by the separation of these two parts. Thus Lord Krishna transferred His power into the body of Bhimasena and informed him of the device by which Jarasandha could be killed. Lord Krishna immediately picked up a twig from a tree and, taking it in His hand, bifurcated it. In this way He hinted to Bhimasena how Jarasandha could be killed. Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is omnipotent, and if he wants to kill someone, no one can save that person. Similarly, if He wants to save someone, no one can kill him.
Informed by the hints of Lord Krishna, Bhimasena immediately took hold of Jarasandha's legs and threw him to the ground. When Jarasandha fell to the ground, Bhimasena immediately pressed one of Jarasandha's legs to the ground and took hold of the other leg with his two hands. Catching Jarasandha in this way, he tore his body in two, from the anus up to the head. As an elephant breaks the branches of a tree in two, so Bhimasena separated the body of Jarasandha. The citizens of Magadha who were standing nearby saw that the body of Jarasandha was now divided into two halves, so that each half had one leg, one thigh, one testicle, one breast, half a backbone, half a chest, one collarbone, one arm, one eye, one ear and half a face.
As soon as the news of Jarasandha's death was announced, all the citizens of Magadha began to cry, ""Alas, alas,"" while Lord Krishna and Arjuna embraced Bhimasena to congratulate him. Although Jarasandha was killed, neither Krishna nor the two Pandava brothers made a claim to the throne. Their purpose in killing Jarasandha was to stop him from creating a disturbance against the proper discharge of world peace. A demon always creates disturbances, whereas a godly person always tries to keep peace in the world. The mission of Lord Krishna is to give protection to the righteous persons and to kill the demons who disturb a peaceful situation. Therefore Lord Krishna immediately called for the son of Jarasandha, whose name was Sahadeva, and with due ritualistic ceremonies He asked him to occupy the seat of his father and reign over the kingdom peacefully. Lord Krishna is the master of the whole cosmic creation, and He wants everyone to live peacefully and execute Krishna consciousness. After installing Sahadeva on the throne, He released all the kings and princes who had been imprisoned unnecessarily by Jarasandha."
24,Sabha Parva,Lord Krishna Benedicts the Imprisoned Kings,"The kings and the princes released by Lord Krishna after the death of Jarasandha were rulers of different parts of the world. When they were released by the grace of Lord Krishna, they all looked very unhappy; their garments were dirty and torn, and their faces were almost dried up due to insufficient food and water. They were very weak due to hunger, and their faces had lost all beauty and luster. Because of the kings' long imprisonment, every part of their bodies had become slackened and invalid. But although suffering in that miserable condition of life, they had the opportunity to pray to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vishnu.
Now before them they saw the color of the transcendental body of Lord Krishna, exactly like the hue of a newly arrived cloud in the sky. He appeared before them nicely covered with yellow colored silken garments, with four hands like Vishnu, and carrying the different symbols of the club, the conchshell, the disc and the lotus flower. There were marks of golden lines on His chest, and the nipples of His breast appeared to be like the whorl of a lotus flower. His eyes appeared to be spread like the petals of a lotus flower, and His smiling face exhibited the symbol of eternal peace and prosperity. His glittering earrings were set beautifully, and His helmet was bedecked with valuable jewels. The Lord's necklace of pearls and the bangles and bracelets nicely situated on His body all shone with a transcendental beauty. The Kaustubha jewel hanging on His chest glittered with great luster, and the Lord wore a beautiful flower garland.
After so much distress, when the kings and princes saw Lord Krishna, with His beautiful transcendental features, they looked upon Him to their hearts' content, as if they were drinking nectar through their eyes, licking His body with their tongues, smelling the aroma of His body with their noses, and embracing Him with their arms. Just by dint of their being in front of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all reactions to their sinful activities were washed away. Therefore, without reservation, they surrendered themselves at the lotus feet of the Lord. It is stated in the Bhagavad-gita that unless one is freed from all kinds of sinful reactions, one cannot fully surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord. All the princes who saw Lord Krishna forgot all their past tribulations. With joined palms and with great devotion, they began to offer prayers to Lord Krishna, as follows.
""Dear Lord, O Supreme Godhead, master of all heavenly beings, You can immediately remove all Your devotees' pangs because Your devotees are fully surrendered unto You. O dear Lord Krishna, O eternal deity of transcendental bliss and knowledge, You are imperishable, and we offer our respectful obeisances unto Your lotus feet. It is by Your causeless mercy that we have been released from the imprisonment of Jarasandha, but now we pray unto You to release us from the imprisonment with the illusory energy of this material existence. Please, therefore, stop our continuous cycle of birth and death. We now have sufficient experience of the miserable material condition of life in which we are fully absorbed, and having tasted its bitterness, we have come to take shelter under Your lotus feet.
""Dear Lord, O killer of the demon Madhu, we can now clearly see that Jarasandha was not at fault in the least; it is actually by Your causeless mercy that we were bereft of our kingdoms because we were very proud of calling ourselves rulers and kings. Any ruler or king who becomes too puffed up with false prestige and power does not get the opportunity to understand his real constitutional position and eternal life. Such foolish so-called rulers and kings become falsely proud of their position under the influence of Your illusory energy; they are like a foolish person who considers a mirage in the desert to be a reservoir of water. Foolish persons think that their material possessions will give them protection, and those who are engaged in sense gratification falsely accept this material world as a place of eternal enjoyment. O Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, we must admit that, before this, we were puffed up with our material opulences. Because we were all envious of each other and wanted to conquer one another, we all engaged in fighting for supremacy, even at the cost of sacrificing the lives of many citizens.""
The kings continued: ""O Lord, we were simply engaged in the abominable task of killing citizens and alluring them to be unnecessarily killed, just to satisfy our political whims. We did not consider that Your Lordship is always present before us in the form of cruel death. We were so fooled that we became the cause of death for others, forgetting our own impending death. But, dear Lord, the retaliation of the time element, which is Your representative, is certainly insurmountable. The time element is so strong that no one can escape its influence; therefore, we have received the reactions of our atrocious activities, and we are now bereft of all opulences and stand before You like street beggars. We consider our position to be Your causeless, unalloyed mercy upon us because now we can understand that we were falsely proud and that our material opulences could be withdrawn from us within a second by Your will.
""By Your causeless mercy only, we are now able to think of Your lotus feet. This is our greatest gain. Dear Lord, it is known to everyone that the body is a breeding ground of diseases. Now we are sufficiently aged, and instead of being proud of our bodily strength, we are getting weaker  by . We are no longer interested in sense gratification or the false happiness derived through the material body. By Your grace, we have now come to the conclusion that hankering after such material happiness is just like searching for water in a desert mirage. We are no longer interested in the results of our pious activities, such as performing great sacrifices in order to be elevated to the heavenly planets. We now understand that such elevation to a material standard of life in the heavenly planets may sound very relishable, but actually there cannot be any happiness within this material world.
""We pray for Your Lordship to favor us by instructing us how to engage in the transcendental loving service of Your lotus feet so that we may never forget our eternal relationship with Your Lordship. We do not want liberation from the entanglement of material existence. By Your will we may take birth in any species of life; it does not matter. We simply pray that we may never forget Your lotus feet under any circumstances. Dear Lord, we now surrender unto Your lotus feet by offering our respectful obeisances unto You because You are the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, Krishna, the son of Vasudeva. You are the Supersoul in everyone's heart, and You are Lord Hari, who can take away all miserable conditions of material existence. Dear Lord, Your name is Govinda, the reservoir of all pleasure. One who is engaged in satisfying Your senses automatically satisfies his own senses also, and therefore You are known as Govinda. Dear Lord, You are ever famous, for You can put an end to all miseries of Your devotees. Please, therefore, accept us as Your surrendered servants.""
After hearing the prayers of the kings, Lord Krishna, who is always the protector of surrendered souls and the ocean of mercy for the devotees, replied to them as follows in His sweetly transcendental voice, which was grave and full of meaning. ""My dear kings,"" He said, ""I bestow upon you My blessings. From this  forth you will have firm devotion to me, the Supreme Self and the Lord of all that be. I assure you this will come to pass, just as you desire. Fortunately you have come to the proper conclusion, my dear kings, and what you have spoken is true. I can see that human beings' lack of self restraint, which stems from their intoxication with opulence and power, simply leads to madness. Haihaya, Nahusha, Vena, Ravana, Narakasura and many other rulers of demigods, men, and demons fell from their elevated positions because of infatuation with material opulence Understanding that this material body and everything connected with it have a beginning and an end, worship Me by Vedic sacrifices, and with clear intelligence protect your subjects in accordance with the principles of religion. As you live your lives, begetting generations of progeny and encountering happiness and distress, birth and death, always keep your minds fixed on Me. Be detached from the body and everything connected to it. Remaining self-satisfied, steadfastly keep your vows while concentrating your minds fully on Me. In this way you will ultimately attain Me, the Supreme Absolute Truth.""
After delivering His instructions to the kings and princes, Lord Krishna immediately arranged for their comfort and asked many servants and maidservants to take care of them. Lord Krishna requested Sahadeva, the son of King Jarasandha, to supply all necessities to the kings and also asked him to show them all respect and honor. In pursuance of the order of Lord Krishna, Sahadeva offered them all honor, and presented them with ornaments, garments, garlands, and other paraphernalia. After taking their baths and dressing very nicely, the kings appeared happy and gentle. Then they were supplied food fit for kings. Lord Krishna supplied everything for their comfort, as was befitting their royal positions.
Since the kings were so mercifully treated by Lord Krishna, they felt great happiness, and all their bright faces appeared just like the stars in the sky after the end of the rainy season. They were all nicely dressed and ornamented, and their earrings glittered. Each one was then seated on a chariot bedecked with gold and jewels and drawn by decorated horses. After seeing that each was taken care of, Lord Krishna, in a sweet voice, asked them to return to their respective kingdoms. By His very liberal behavior, unparalleled in the history of the world, Lord Krishna released all the kings who had been in the clutches of Jarasandha, and being fully satisfied, the kings began to engage in chanting His holy name, thinking of His holy form, and glorifying His transcendental pastimes as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
So engaged, they returned to their respective kingdoms. The citizens of their kingdoms were very greatly pleased to see them return; and when they heard of the kind dealings of Lord Krishna, they all became very happy. The kings began to manage the affairs of their kingdoms in accordance with the instructions of Lord Krishna, and all those kings and their subjects passed their s very happily.
After thus causing the annihilation of Jarasandha by Bhimasena and after being properly honored by Sahadeva, the son of Jarasandha, Lord Krishna, accompanied by Bhimasena and Arjuna, returned to the city of Hastinapura. When they reached the precincts of Hastinapura, they blew their respective conchshells; and by hearing the sound vibrations and understanding who was arriving, everyone immediately became cheerful. But upon hearing the conchshells, the enemies of Krishna became very sorry. The citizens of Indraprastha felt their hearts become joyful simply by hearing the vibration of Krishna's conchshell because they could understand that Jarasandha had been killed. Now the performance of the Rajasuya sacrifice by King Yudhisthira was almost certain. Bhimasena, Arjuna, and Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, arrived before King Yudhisthira and offered their respects to the King. King Yudhisthira attentively heard the narration of the killing of Jarasandha and the setting free of the kings. He also heard of the tactics which were adopted by Krishna to kill Jarasandha. The king was naturally affectionate toward Krishna, but after hearing the story, he became even more bound in love for Krishna; tears of ecstasy glided from his eyes, and he became so stunned that he was almost unable to speak.
After the slaying Jarasandha, King Yudhisthira sent his brothers to conquer the other kings of the earth. He sent Arjuna to the north, Bhima to the east, Sahadeva to the south and Nakula to the west. The intention of the brothers was not to claim the thrones of these kings, but to defeat them, extract tribute and make them agree to King Yudhisthira's domination. After being subjected, the defeated kings were invited to Maharaja Yudhisthira's Rajasuya sacrifice.
Arjuna, the mighty bowman, first of all subjugated King Bhagadatta, who accepted subordination under King Yudhisthira. Arjuna then marched against King Vrihanta, and one kingdom after another was brought under the sway of Maharaja Yudhisthira. Arjuna conquered Modapura, the Northern Ulukas, the kshatriyas of Kashmira and the seven tribes called Utsava-sanketa. The mighty son of Kunti then defeated King Viswagaswa of the Puru race. He then conquered the Trigartas, the Daravas, the Kokonadas and various other kshatriyas. The prince of the Kuru race then took the delightful town of Avisari, and then brought under his sway the king of Uraga named Rochamana. The exalted son of Pandu then defeated the Daradas along with the Kambhojas. In a terrible battle Arjuna subjugated the Rishikas. At last having conquered all the land of the Himalayas and the Nishkuta mountains, that bull among men encamped at the white mountains.
Arjuna then subjugated the Kimpurushas ruled by Durmaputra. He then defeated the Guhakas from a country called Harataka. The Kuru prince then beheld the Manasa Ganga lake and other lakes sacred to the Rishis. At last the son of Pandu arrived in the country north of Harivarsha and desired to conquer it. Thereupon certain frontier guards endowed with huge bodies approached him with gallant hearts and advised him, ""O son of Pritha, this tract of land can never be conquered by you. If you value your well being, please return to your kingdom, for any human who enters this region, will surely perish. We are satisfied with you prowess; O hero, your conquest must stop here. This is where the northern Kurus live, and war does not exist here. Even if you were to enter this region, you could not see anything for human eyes cannot perceive the subtle forms that exist here. If, however, you desire something, please tell us so that we may do your bidding.""
""If your land cannot be seen by human beings,"" Arjuna said, ""then I shall not enter it. However, I desire that some offering be paid to King Yudhisthira as tribute."" Immediately, guards brought celestial cloths made of the finest silk, and they also brought dazzling jeweled ornaments and skins. After conquering all countries of the north and extracting tribute and subordination from those kings, Arjuna brought back the enormous wealth to King Yudhisthira. The wealth consisted of unseen jewels and gems, and horses from the species called Tittiri and Kalmasha, whose color was like that of parrot wings and peacocks, and who were endowed with the speed of the wind.
As ordered by King Yudhisthira, Bhima marched toward the east with a great army. Within a short time that bull of the Bharata race conquered the Gandakas, Videhas and the Dasarnas. The king of the Dasarnas was named Sudharman. He fought a fierce battle with Bhima using only his mighty arms. Bhima was so pleased with the King that he made him commander in chief of his forces. Bhima then defeated Rochamana, the king of Aswamedha. Bhima then marched into Pulinda and brought Sukumara and King Sumitra under his sway. Bhima then challenged Shishupala and the Chedis. However, Shishupala treated Bhima with great respect and offered him his kingdom. Bhima requested Shishupala to be present for the Rajasuya sacrifice of Yudhisthira. Bhima then subjugated the Koshalas, the northern Koshalas, and the king of Ayodhya. The mighty son of Kunti then defeated the warriors from Vatsabhumi and the king of the Bhargas. He defeated Janaka, the king of the Videhas, then the Kiratas, then the son of Jarasandha, Sahadeva. Bhima encountered Karna and defeating him made him pay tribute to Maharaja Yudhisthira. Paundraka, who was later killed by Lord Krishna, was also subjugated by Bhima. After defeating innumerable monarches and exacting tribute from them all of them, he marched back to Indraprastha. The illustrious son of Kunti brought back a downpour of wealth consisting of coins and gems counted in hundreds and millions. He offered the entire wealth at the feet of Yudhisthira, the great.
Sahadeva, on the order of Maharaja Yudhisthira, marched toward the southern countries. He defeated the Surasenas, the Matsyas and brought under his sway Dantavakra, the mighty king of Adhirajas. He conquered the Nishadas and the kings of Avanti, Vinda and Anuvinda. He brought under Maharaja Yudhisthira's rule, King Bhishmaka and the king of the Koshalas. Sahadeva then fought with Mainda and Dvivida, the kings of Kishkinda. Then Sahadeva encountered his toughest challenge at Mahismati; he fought with king Nila, who was aided by Agni, the fire god. The encounter between the two forces was fierce, terrible and bloody, and before long Agni, the fire god, was scorching the front line of chariots, elephants and soldiers in Sahadeva's army. Witnessing the possible extinction of his army, Sahadeva did not know what to do.
Agni had taken the side of King Nila because of the King's beautiful daughter. When the girl was young, she used to stay near the sacrificial fire causing it to blaze forth. As it came to pass, King Nila's sacrificial fire, even if fanned, would not blaze up till agitated by the gentle breath from the girl's fair lips. It came to be known that Agni desired the beautiful young girl for his wife. The girl also accepted a proposal from Agni. One  the deity assuming the form of a brahmana was happily enjoying the company of the young girl when he was discovered by the King. The King was enraged and ordered the brahmana to be punished according to law. However, Agni flamed up in wrath, and the King, struck with wonder, immediately offered his daughter to the fire god. Accepting the King's daughter for his wife, Agni requested the king to take a benediction. The King asked that his troops would never panic while engaged in battle. From that time on any king who was foolish enough to attack Mahismati had his troops consumed by fire. Now the same thing was happening to Sahadeva's troops.
The mighty son of Pandu, however, stood his ground like an unmovable mountain. He purified himself and touched water. He then pacified the fire god with sweet words. Agni approached Sahadeva and gave him assurance, ""O thou of the Kuru race, cease from offering prayers. I was only testing you. I know your purpose for subjugating the kings of the earth. However, O best of the Bharata race, as long as there is a descendant of King Nila's line, I will protect this town of Mahismati. I will, however, satisfy your desire."" Agni then disappeared and soon King Nila appeared at Agni's request and paid tribute to King Yudhisthira.
Sahadeva then continued his conquest and soon received tribute from King Rukmi of Bhojakata and conquered all the kings of the south. He even exacted tribute from Vibhishana, the brother of Ravana and ruler of Lanka. Sahadeva, after accumulating vast hordes of wealth, returned to King Yudhisthira and presented all that he had collected.
Nakula, the heroic son of Pandu, went toward the east and collected tribute from those monarches who accepted King Yudhisthira's rule. He conquered the Dasarnas, the Karnatas, the Amvasthas, the Malavas and the Mlechcha tribes of the East. When Nakula came to Dvaraka, Lord Krishna, the Supreme Lord, gladly accepted the subjugation of King Yudhisthira, for the Lord is always conquered by the devotion of devotees. He is known as Ajita, unconquerable, but He is conquered by the love of His devotees. Nakula then approached his uncle, King Salya, who gladly accepted subordination under King Yudhisthira. King Salya bestowed upon Nakula large amounts of jewels and gold coins. So great was the treasure that Nakula exacted from various kings that ten thousand camels could carry it only with great difficulty. He entered Indraprastha and offered all that wealth at the feet of his brother, the magnanimous King Yudhisthira."
25,Sabha Parva,Shishupala's Liberation,"The kingdom of Maharaja Yudhisthira continued to prosper, and he was able to give full protection to his citizens, both materially and spiritually, because he always spoke of the Absolute Truth. His humble nature and his devotion to truth always kept his would be enemies in check. The citizens happily engaged in their respective occupational duties. Due to the rule of the pious monarch, there was as much rain in the kingdom as the citizens desired. All cities and towns in Maharaja Yudhisthira's kingdom became highly prosperous. Indeed, cow protection, farming and trading flourished beyond the expectations of the vaishya class. During the reign of Maharaja Yudhisthira, robbers and thieves never cheated anyone because there was plenty for all. There were no droughts, floods, plagues, earthquakes, famine, fires, or premature deaths in the kingdom of Maharaja Yudhisthira. In order to please Maharaja Yudhisthira, the kings of the earth used to serve him, worship him or offer tribute to that king of kings. The large treasure house of the emperor was so filled with hoards of wealth that it could not be emptied by a hundred years of charity. Seeing the state of his treasury, Maharaja Yudhisthira set his heart on performing the Rajasuya sacrifice.
Maharaja Yudhisthira's friends, ministers and officers, separately and together, approached him and advised, ""The time has come, O exalted one, for the performance of the Rajasuya sacrifice. All arrangements should be made as soon as possible.""
While these discussions were going on, Lord Hari (Krishna), the omniscient and oldest person of all, arrived in the kingdom of Maharaja Yudhisthira. That Supreme Lord has been described by those possessing knowledge as the omniscient Supersoul of every being, as the soul of the Vedas, as the foremost of all existences in the universe, as the origin of all things, as the cause of all causes, as that in which all things come to be resolved, and as the lord of the past, present and future. He has been called Keshava, the slayer of the Keshi demon, the dispeller of all fear in times of distress and the annihilator of all foes. That Supreme Personality of Godhead, being pleased by the devotion of Maharaja Yudhisthira, entered the pious city of Indraprastha, bringing with Him a large mass of treasure, including an inexhaustible ocean of gems that would be the envy of any enemy.
The capital of the Bharata dynasty was gladdened by Lord Krishna's presence just as a dark region becomes joyful by the sun's rising, or as one feels a cool gentle breeze on a hot summer . The citizens of Indraprastha greeted that Lord of Lords with all the devotion in their hearts. Approaching Him lovingly and with due respect, Maharaja Yudhisthira inquired of His welfare. Offering Lord Krishna a seat of honor, Maharaja Yudhisthira, who was accompanied by Dhaumya, Vyasadeva, the sacrificial priests and Bhima and Arjuna, addressed Lord Krishna as follows, ""My dear Lord Krishna, it is by your grace that this entire earth has been brought under my sway. And it is through your mercy that I have obtained the vast wealth in my treasury. I desire to devote that wealth according to scripture unto the direction of superior brahmanas and the carrier of the sacrificial libations. I am asking Your permission, O thou of the Dasarha race, to perform this sacrifice along with my brothers. My dear Krishna, O eternal form of bliss and knowledge, all the exalted directors of the affairs of this material world, including Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva and King Indra, are always anxious to receive and carry out orders from You; and whenever they are fortunate enough to receive such orders, they immediately obey them in their hearts. O Krishna, You are unlimited, and although we  think of ourselves as royal kings and rulers of the world and become puffed up over our paltry positions, we are very poor in heart. Actually, we are fit to be punished by You, but the wonder is that instead of punishing us, You so kindly and mercifully accept our orders and carry them out properly. Others are very surprised that Your Lordship can play the part of an ordinary human, but we can understand that You are performing these activities just like a stage actor. Your real position is always exalted, exactly like that of the sun, which always remains at the same temperature both during the time of its rising and the time of its setting. Although we feel the difference in temperature between the rising and the setting sun, the temperature of the sun never changes. You are always transcendentally equipoised, and thus You are neither pleased nor disturbed by any condition of material affairs. You are the Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead, and for You there are no relativities. My dear Madhava, You are never defeated by anyone. Material distinctions - 'This is me.' 'This is you.' 'This is mine.' 'This is yours.'--are all conspicuous by dint of their absence in You. Such distinctions are visible in the lives of everyone, even the animals, but those who are pure devotees are freed from these false distinctions. Since these distinctions are absent in Your devotees, they cannot possibly be present in You.""
After satisfying Lord Krishna in this way, King Yudhisthira arranged to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. He invited all the qualified brahmanas and sages to take part and appointed them to different positions as priests in charge of the sacrificial arena. He invited the most expert brahmanas and sages, whose names are as follows: Krishna-dvaipayana Vyasadeva, Bharadvaja, Sumantu, Gautama, Asita, Vashistha, Chyavana, Kanva, Maitreya, Kavasa, Trita, Visvamitra, Vamadeva, Sumati, Jaimini, Kratu, Paila, Parasara, Garga, Vaisampayana, Atharva, Kasyapa, Dhaumya, Parasurama, Sukracharya, Asuri, Vitihotra, Madhucchanda, Virasena, and Akritavrana. Besides all these brahmanas and sages, he invited such respectful senior members of the Kuru Dynasty as Dronacharya, Bhishma, the grandfather of the Kurus, Kripacharya, and Dhritarastra. He also invited all the sons of Dhritarastra, headed by Duryodhana, and the great devotee Vidura was also invited. Kings from different parts of the world, along with their ministers and secretaries, were also invited to see the great sacrifice performed by King Yudhisthira, and the citizens, comprising learned brahmanas, chivalrous kshatriyas, well-to-do vaishyas, and faithful shudras, all visited the ceremony.
The kings who came for the Rajasuya sacrifice were received by Maharaja Yudhisthira and treated to heavenly opulence. All those monarches were assigned to mansions that equaled the abodes of the heavenly gods. The mansions were white as clouds and high as mount Kailasa. There were beautifully designed and filled with ornate furniture. They were enclosed with high boundary walls and surrounded by gardens and water tanks filled with lotus flowers. The lattice windows were covered with gold, and the walls were covered with rows of pearls and other valuable gems. The floors, too, were made of gems, and some were covered with costly carpets. Flower garlands hung here and there, and scented perfumes filled the air. These mansions were covered in white marble and looked like the the snow capped mountains of the Himalayas. The doors and entrances were uniformly set and were wide enough to admit a crowd. Adorned with various costly articles and built with various metals, they looked like the peaks of Mount Himavat. The kings of the earth were very satisfied with the reception of Maharaja Yudhisthira.
The brahmana priests and sages in charge of the sacrificial ceremony broke the sacrificial ground with a golden plow, and they initiated King Yudhisthira as the performer of the great sacrifice, in accordance with Vedic rituals. Long years ago, when Varuna performed a similar sacrifice, all the sacrificial utensils were made of gold. In the Rajasuya sacrifice of King Yudhisthira, all the utensils required for the sacrifice were also golden.
In order to participate in the great sacrifice performed by King Yudhisthira, all the exalted demigods like Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva, and Indra the King of heaven, accompanied by their associates, as well as the predominating deities of higher planetary systems like Gandharvaloka, Siddhaloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, Nagaloka, Yakshaloka, Rakshasaloka, Pakshiloka and Charanaloka, as well as famous kings and their queens, were all present by the invitation of King Yudhisthira. All the respectable sages, kings and demigods who assembled there unanimously agreed that King Yudhisthira was quite competent to take the responsibility of performing the Rajasuya sacrifice; no one was in disagreement on this fact. All of them knew thoroughly the position of King Yudhisthira; because he was a great devotee of Lord Krishna, no accomplishment was extraordinary for him.
Maharaja Yudhisthira requested certain persons to help him with the sacrifice. He appointed Bhima to superintend the food department and other enjoyable things. He asked Ashvatthama to wait on and serve the needs of any brahmana who came to the sacrifice. Sanjaya was appointed to serve and offer worship to all kings who came to the sacrifice. Bhishma and Drona were appointed to see that no detail of the reception was neglected. Kripa was appointed to look after the diamonds, pearls, other gems and gold that was offered to King Yudhisthira. He was also in charge of distribution of gifts to brahmanas. Balhika, Dhritarastra, Somadatta, and Jayadratha went about enjoying themselves as lords of the sacrifice. Duryodhana was requested to become the receiver of tributes that were brought by kings. Whatever was offered to King Yudhisthira as gifts was counted by Duryodhana and stored properly. Vidura was put in charge of distributing charity at the right time and to proper persons. Lord Krishna, the center of all worlds and round whom every creature moved, was engaged by His own will in washing the feet of the brahmanas.
King Yudhisthira, himself, brought a large amount of wealth to the sacrificial arena. Everyone honored Maharaja Yudhisthira with large presents of jewels. And each king made a present of his wealth, flattering himself with the proud belief that the jewels he gave would enable King Yudhisthira to complete his sacrifice.
The learned brahmanas and priests saw to it that the sacrifice by Maharaja Yudhisthira was performed in exactly the same way as in bygone ages by the demigod Varuna. According to the Vedic system, whenever there is an arrangement for sacrifice, the members participating in the sacrifice are offered the juice of the soma plant. The juice of the soma plant is a kind of life-giving beverage. On the  of extracting the soma juice, King Yudhisthira very respectfully received the special priest who had been engaged to detect any mistake in the formalities of sacrificial procedures. The Vedic mantras must be enunciated perfectly and chanted with the proper accent; if the priests who are engaged in this business commit any mistake, the referee priest immediately corrects the procedure, and thus the ritualistic performances are perfectly executed. Unless it is perfectly executed, a sacrifice cannot yield the desired result.
Another important procedure is that the most exalted personality in the assembly of such a sacrificial ceremony is first offered worship. After all arrangements were made for Yudhisthira's sacrifice, the next consideration was who should be worshipped first in the ceremony. This particular ceremony is called Agrapuja. Agra means first, and puja means worship. In the sacrificial assembly, all the members were very exalted. Some proposed to elect one person as the perfect candidate for accepting Agrapuja, and others proposed someone else.
Then Bhishma, the son of Shantanu, spoke giving his opinion, ""As the sun is the center of all luminescing objects, so Krishna is the center of all living beings. Our sacrificial altar is illuminated and blessed by His presence as a sunless region is blessed by the sun. Therefore, I feel that Krishna should be the first worshiped in this assembly.""
Bhishma, the great grandsire of the Kurus, then ordered Sahadeva to offer the Agrapuja to Lord Krishna. However, Shishupala could not bear to see that worship offered to Lord Krishna. He spoke up influenced by envy and hatred, ""O descendant of the Kuru race, this Krishna does not deserve royal worship as if he were a king. You sons of Pandu are acting like children. Bhishma, the son of Ganga, obviously, possesses little knowledge. He deserves to be censured amongst the honest and wise. How does this one of the Yadu dynasty, who is not even a king, deserve worship before all the exalted kings present? Krishna is not certainly the oldest in age, for here is His father, Vasudeva. If you regard Krishna as a well wisher, there is a greater well wisher present here as King Drupada. When Drona is present, how could you regard Krishna as a greater preceptor? Do you regard Krishna as greater in wisdom than Dvaipayana Vyasa? Amongst the warriors present, the great Bhishma, who can die only at his will, stand supreme. How could Krishna receive worship before him? When Ashvatthama, the knower of every branch of knowledge is present, how could you worship Krishna? When Duryodhana, the bull of the Bharata race, is present how could Krishna be worshipped first? Passing over Kripa, the preceptor of the Bharata princes, why have you worshiped Krishna? When Bhishmaka, Rukmi, Ekalavya, Salya or Karna are present, how could you worship Krishna? This slayer of Madhu is neither a sacrificial priest, nor a preceptor, nor a king. With what understanding have you worshiped Krishna? O chief of the Kurus, you have rejected qualified persons to be first worshiped from motives for gain. If you had planned to worship this Krishna, then why have you brought all these kings here to be insulted? This wretch born of the Vrishni race has caused the slaying of King Jarasandha by unrighteous means. O Yudhisthira, you have abandoned righteousness to.""
Then turning to Lord Krishna, Shishupala, who was bringing death upon his head, spoke the following death knell of words, ""O Janardana, why have You accepted the position of being first worshiped? You have acted like a dog that laps up clarified butter stolen from the sacrifice. O slayer of Madhu, as a wife is to one without virile power, as a fine play is to one who is blind, so this royal worship is to thee who are not even a king.""
Having spoken these words, Shishupala rose from his seat, and accompanied by many kings, attempted to leave the assembly. King Yudhisthira hastily ran after Shishupala and tried to correct his wayward mentality, ""O Lord of the earth, what you have said is scarcely proper for you. It is improper and highly sinful. Do not insult Bhishma by saying that he does not know what virtue is. Behold these many kings, older than you, who approve of the worship of Krishna. It behoves you to follow their example. O ruler of Chedi, Bhishma knows Lord Krishna in truth. You must learn from him the glory of Krishna.""
Bhishma then spoke up in the assembly of kings, ""He who does not approve of the worship of Krishna, the oldest person in the universe, deserves no soft words of conciliation. Any warrior of the Kshatriya race, who defeats all other warriors in battle and then sets his opponent free, becomes the preceptor of his opponent. I do not behold in this assembly of kings even one ruler who has not been subdued in battle by Krishna. The whole universe without limit can be found in Krishna. He deserves, not only the worship of all kings here, but of every living being. Therefore we worship Krishna as the oldest, but who remains ever fresh and as the foremost of all living beings. I have, O Shishupala, waited upon many sages experienced in knowledge. These wise men have explained to me in detail the glory of Krishna. I have heard many times the divine acts performed by Janardana since His birth. We do not, O King of Chedi, worship Krishna in hope of obtaining material benefits. All good men on earth worship that one who has no origin and who is the source of happiness for every creature. We have offered to Him the first worship because in Him resides all beauty, knowledge, power, renunciation, fame and glory.
""There is none in this assembly who we have not taken into consideration. Lord Krishna is the foremost among the brahmanas, kshatriyas, vaishyas and shudras. As far as knowledgeable persons are concerned, He is the most learned in Vedas; indeed, He is the source of all Vedic knowledge. In this eminent person resides liberality, cleverness, knowledge of the Vedas, bravery, modesty, achievements, infinite intelligence, humility, beauty, firmness, contentment and prosperity. All these dwell in Achyuta, the infallible one. Therefore, O Kings, it behooves you to offer first worship to Krishna, the Lord of all beings.
""Hrishikesha is the sacrificial priest, the guru, the king, the best friend; and therefore He has been offered first worship. Krishna is the source of this universe and into who this universe will dissolve. Indeed this universe of mobile and immobile creatures has sprung into existence by the grace of Krishna only. He is the unmanifest primal cause, the creator, the eternal Lord and protector of all creatures. Therefore, why doesn't He of unfading glory deserve to be worshiped first. This Shishupala is a mere child, because he doesn't not know this Supreme Lord of all lords.""
When Bhishma had stopped speaking, Sahadeva responded to the offensive words of Shishupala, ""If there be any king amongst you who cannot bear to see Keshava, the killer of the Keshi demon, as the first person worshiped, I will place my foot on his head."" When Sahadeva lifted his foot, no king challenged him. Suddenly, a shower of flowers fell on Sahadeva and an unembodied voice exclaimed, ""Excellent! Excellent!""
Then Narada, clad in black deerskin and speaking of both the past and future, spoke the following words with the clearest import, ""Those men who will not worship the lotus-eyed Krishna should be regarded as dead although life may reside in the body. In fact, one who does not regard Krishna as the first person to be worshiped should not be seen or spoken to.""
When their was grumbling among the followers of Shishupala and the matter remained undecided, Sahadeva again began to speak in favor of Lord Krishna. He said, ""Lord Krishna, the best amongst the members of the Yadu dynasty and the protector of His devotees, is the most exalted personality in this assembly. Therefore I think that He should without any objection be offered the honor of being worshiped first. Although demigods such as Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva, Indra, the King of the heavenly planets, and many other exalted personalities are present in this assembly, no one can be equal to or greater than Krishna in terms of time, space, riches, strength, reputation, wisdom, renunciation or any other consideration. Anything which is considered opulent is present originally in Krishna. As an individual soul is the basic principle of the growth of his material body, similarly Krishna is the Supersoul of this cosmic manifestation. All kinds of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies, such as the performance of sacrifices, the offering of oblations in the fire, the chanting of the Vedic hymns and the practice of mystic yoga--all are meant for realizing Krishna. Whether one follows the path of fruitive activities or the path of philosophical speculation, the ultimate destination is Krishna; all bona fide methods of self-realization are meant for understanding Krishna. O respectable persons present, it is superfluous to speak about Krishna, because every one of you exalted personalities know the Supreme Brahman, Lord Krishna, for whom there are no material differences between body and soul, between energy and the energetic, or between one part of the body and another. Since everyone is a part and parcel of Krishna, there is no qualitative difference between Krishna and all living entities. Everything is an emanation of Krishna's energies, the material and spiritual energies. Krishna's energies are like the heat and light of the fire; there is no difference between the quality of heat and light of the fire itself.
""Also, Krishna can do anything He likes with any part of His body. We can execute a particular action with the help of a particular part of our body, but He can do anything and everything with any part of His body. And because His transcendental body is full of knowledge and bliss in eternity, he doesn't undergo the six kinds of material changes--birth, existence, growth, fruitive action, dwindling and vanishing. Unforced by any external energy, He is the supreme cause of the creation, maintenance and dissolution of everything that be. By the grace of Krishna only, everyone is engaged in the practice of religiousness, the development of economic conditions, the satisfaction of the senses and, ultimately, the achievement of liberation from material bondage. These four principles of progressive life can be executed by the mercy of Krishna only. He should therefore be offered the first worship of this great sacrifice, and no one should disagree. As by watering the root, the watering of the branches, twigs, leaves and flowers is automatically accomplished, or as by supplying food to the stomach, the nutrition and metabolism of all parts of the body are automatically established, so by offering the first worship to Krishna, everyone present in this meeting--including the great demigods--will be satisfied. If anyone is charitably disposed, it will be very good for him to give in charity only to Krishna, who is the Supersoul of everyone, regardless of his particular body or individual personality. Krishna is present as the Supersoul in every living being; and if we can satisfy Him, then automatically every living being becomes satisfied.""
After this speech was delivered, all the members present in that great sacrificial assembly applauded, confirming his words continuously by saying, ""Everything that you have said is completely perfect. Everything that you have said is completely perfect."" King Yudhisthira, after hearing the confirmation of all present, especially of the brahmanas and learned sages, finished worshiping Lord Krishna according to the regulative principles of the Vedic injunctions. First of all, King Yudhisthira--along with his brothers, wives, children, other relatives and ministers-washed the lotus feet of Lord Krishna and sprinkled the water on their heads. After this, Lord Krishna was offered various kinds of silken garments of yellow color, and heaps of jewelry and ornaments were presented before Him for His use.
King Yudhisthira felt such ecstasy by honoring Krishna, who was his only lovable object, that tears glided down from his eyes; and although He wanted to, he could not see Lord Krishna very well. Lord Krishna was thus worshiped by King Yudhisthira. At that time all the members present in that assembly stood up with folded hands and began to chant, ""Jaya! Namah! Namah!"" When all joined together to offer their respectful obeisances to Krishna, there were showers of flowers from the sky.
After the Agrapuja had been completed, King Shishupala could not tolerate such honor being offered to Krishna nor hear the glorification of His qualities. Instead of being happy to hear the glories of the Lord, he became very angry. When everyone offered respect to Krishna by standing up, Shishupala remained in his seat; but when he became angry at Krishna's being honored, Shishupala stood up suddenly, and raising his hand, began to speak very strongly and fearlessly against Lord Krishna. He spoke in such a way that Lord Krishna could hear him very distinctly.
 ""Ladies and gentlemen, I can appreciate now the statement of the Vedas that, after all, time is the predominating factor. In spite of all endeavors to the contrary, the time element executes its own plan without opposition. For example, one may try his best to live, but when the time for death comes, no one can check it. I see here that although there are many stalwart personalities present in this assembly, the influence of time is so strong that they have been misled by the statement of a boy who has foolishly spoken about Krishna. There are many learned sages and elderly persons present, but still they have accepted the statement of a foolish boy. This means that by the influence of time, even the intelligence of such honored persons as are present in this meeting can be misdirected. I fully agree with the respectable persons present here that they are competent enough to select the personality who can be first worshiped, but I cannot agree with the statement of a boy like Sahadeva, who has spoken so highly about Krishna and has recommended that Krishna is fit to accept the first worship in the sacrifice. I can see that in this meeting there are many personalities who have undergone great austerities, who are highly learned and who have performed many penances. By their knowledge and direction, they can deliver many persons who are suffering from the pangs of material existence. There are great rishis here whose knowledge has no bounds, as well as many self- realized persons and brahmanas also; and therefore, I think that any one of them could have been selected for the first worship because they are worshipable even by the great demigods, kings and emperors. I cannot understand how you could have selected this cowherd boy, Krishna, and have left aside all these other great personalities. I think Krishna to be no better than a crow! How can He be fit to accept the first worship in this great sacrifice?
""We cannot even ascertain as yet to which caste this Krishna belongs or what His actual occupational duty is. Krishna does not belong to a respectable family. He is so independent that no one knows His principles of religious life. It appears that He is outside the jurisdiction of all religious principles. He always acts independently, not caring for the Vedic injunctions and regulative principles. Therefore He is devoid of all good qualities."" Shishupala indirectly praised Krishna by saying that He is not within the jurisdiction of Vedic injunction. This is true because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That He has no qualities means that Krishna has no material qualities; and because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He acts independently, not caring for conventions or social or religious principles.
Shishupala continued: ""Under these circumstances, how can He be fit to accept the first worship in the sacrifice? Krishna is so foolish that He has left Mathura, which is inhabited by highly elevated persons following the Vedic culture, and He has taken shelter in the ocean, where there is not even talk of the Vedas. Instead of living openly, He has constructed a fort within the water and is living in an atmosphere where there is no discussion of Vedic knowledge. And whenever He comes out of the fort, He simply harasses the citizens like a dacoit, thief or rogue.""
Shishupala went crazy because Krishna was elected the supreme first- worshiped person in that meeting, and he spoke so irresponsibly that it appeared that he had lost all his good fortune. Being overcast with misfortune, Shishupala continued to insult Krishna further, and Lord Krishna patiently heard him without protest. Just as a lion does not care when a flock of jackals howl, Lord Krishna remained silent and unprovoked. Krishna did not reply to even a single accusation made by Shishupala, but all the members present in the meeting, except for a few who agreed with Shishupala, became very agitated because it is the duty of any respectable person not to tolerate blasphemy against God or His devotee. Some of them, who thought that they could not properly take action against Shishupala, left the assembly in protest, covering their ears with their hands in order not to hear further accusations. Thus they left the meeting condemning the action of Shishupala. It is the Vedic injunction that whenever there is blasphemy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one must immediately leave. If he does not do so, he becomes bereft of pious activities and is degraded to the lower condition of life.
All the kings present, belonging to the Kuru dynasty, Matsya dynasty, Kekaya dynasty and Shrinjaya dynasty, became very angry and immediately took up their swords and shields to kill Shishupala. Bhimasena became overwhelmed with rage and stood up to fight with Shishupala. However, Bhishma grabbed him and would not let him proceed further. Bhishma then spoke to Bhima to pacify his anger, ""This Shishupala in not destined to be killed by you. The force, under which the King of Chedi boasts so foolishly, is scarcely of his own, but the Lord of the universe. O Bhima, what king is there who would dare abuse me as this wretch, already possessed by death, has done to. This king of Chedi is without doubt under the influence of Lord Hari's energy. And surely the Lord desires to take him back to Vaikuntha. Due to the Lord's influence, Shishupala roars like a lion caring little for all kings present.
""Listen as I relate his history. Shishupala was born with four hands and three eyes, and upon his birth, he screamed like an ass. His parents were intently thinking of abandoning him for fear that he was a demon. Just when they were about to rid themselves of the child, a voice from the heavens spoke, 'Do not abandon this child. He will prove to be a powerful warrior and will obtain all good fortune. He is not destined to die in his childhood. The person that will kill him has been born into this world already.'
Bhishma continued, ""Hearing the unembodied voice, the mother inquired, 'Who will be the slayer of my son?' The invisible being replied, 'The child will lose his two extra arms and eye when he is placed on the lap of a certain guest, and it will be that person who will slay your son.' Although the child was placed upon the lap of thousands of kings and princes, still the prophecy did not come true. One  Lord Krishna and Balarama came to the kingdom of the Chedis. They worshipped Their aunt and were given a fitting reception. When They took their seats, the queen brought the child to Krishna and placed it in His lap. The child immediately lost his two extra arms and the third eye. The queen in great anxiety then begged a benediction from Lord Krishna, 'O mighty armed Krishna, please grant me that You will excuse the offences of my son Shishupala.' Lord Krishna replied, 'O my aunt, I say that I will pardon one hundred offences committed by your son. Do not grieve for his life.' O Bhima, this King is not destined to be killed by you. He has already committed over one hundred offences, and he will soon be killed by the Lord of the universe, Himself.""
Shishupala did not become even slightly agitated by Bhishma's words. Many of the kings present were ready to kill him for his offenses to Lord Krishna and others. He did not care to think of the pros and cons of his foolish talking; and when he saw that all the kings were ready to kill him, instead of stopping, he stood to fight with them and took up his sword and shield. When Lord Krishna saw that they were going to engage in fighting in the arena of the auspicious Rajasuya yajna, He personally pacified them. Out of His causeless mercy He Himself decided to kill Shishupala. When Shishupala was abusing the kings who were about to attack him, Lord Krishna took up His disc, which was as sharp as the blade of a razor, and immediately separated the head of Shishupala from his body.
When Shishupala was thus killed, a great roar and howl went up from the crowd of that assembly. Taking advantage of that disturbance, the few kings who were supporters of Shishupala quickly left the assembly out of fear of their lives. But despite all this, the fortunate Shishupala's spirit soul went to Krishna and worshiped him and then immediately merged into the body of Lord Krishna in the presence of all members, exactly as a burning meteor falls to the surface of the globe. Shishupala's soul merging into the transcendental body of Krishna fulfilled the the four Kumara's curse of Jaya and Vijaya, who fell to the material world from the Vaikuntha planets. For their return to the Vaikuntha world, it was arranged that both Jaya and Vijaya for three consecutive births would act as deadly enemies of the Lord, and at the end of these lives they would again return to the Vaikuntha world and serve the Lord as His associates.
After the salvation of Shishupala, King Yudhisthira rewarded all the members present in the sacrificial assembly. He sufficiently remunerated the priests and the learned sages for their engagement in the sacrifice. After the sacrifice, King Yudhisthira stood in the midst of all the learned sages and brahmanas, and he seemed exactly like the King of heaven and thus looked very beautiful. King Yudhisthira sufficiently rewarded all the demigods who participated in the sacrifice, and being greatly satisfied, all of them left praising the King's activities and glorifying Lord Krishna.
Lord Krishna thus enabled the performance of the Rajasuya yajna arranged by King Yudhisthira to be successfully completed, and, being requested by His cousins and relatives, He remained in Hastinapura for a few months more.
Thus Ends the Mahabharata Summation to the Sixth Chapter of the Sabha Parva, Entitled, Shishupala's Liberation."
26,Sabha Parva,"Duryodhana Embarassed at the Palace of King Yudhisthira","King Yudhisthira was known as Ajatrashatru, or a person who has no enemy. Therefore, when all men, all demigods, all kings, sages and saints saw the successful termination of the Rajasuya sacrifice performed by King Yudhisthira, they became very happy. King Yudhisthira, was a great soul. His congenial disposition attracted everyone as his friend, and therefore he was known as Ajatrashatru, one who never created an enemy.
After Shishupala had died by the mercy of Lord Krishna and had become merged in the spiritual existence, and after the end of the Rajasuya sacrifice, when all friends, guests and well-wishers had been sufficiently honored and rewarded, King Yudhisthira went to bathe in the Ganges. While traveling in procession, different musical instruments, such as mridangas, conchshells, drums, kettledrums and bugles, vibrated. In addition, the ankle bells of the dancing girls jingled. Many groups of professional singers played vinas, flutes, gongs and cymbals, and thus a tumultuous sound vibrated in the sky. The princely guests from many kingdoms, like Shrinjaya, Kambhoja, Kuru, Kekaya and Kosala, were present with their different flags and gorgeously decorated elephants, chariots, horses and soldiers. All were passing in a procession to the Ganges, and King Yudhisthira was in the forefront.
The sacrificial heads, such as the priests, religious ministers and brahmanas, were all were loudly chanting the Vedic hymns. The demigods, the inhabitants of the Pitriloka and Gandharvaloka, as well as many sages, showered flowers from the sky. The men and women of Indraprastha, their bodies smeared with scents and floral oils, were nicely dressed in colorful garments and decorated with garlands, jewels and ornaments. They were all enjoying the ceremony, and they threw other liquid substances like water, oil, milk, butter and yogurt. Some even smeared these on each other's bodies. In this way, they were enjoying the occasion. The professional prostitutes were also engaged by jubilantly smearing these liquid substances on the bodies of the men, and the men reciprocated in the same way. All the liquid substances had been mixed with turmeric and saffron, and their color was lustrous yellow.
In order to witness the avabhrita bath of King Yudhisthira, many wives of the demigods had come in different airplanes, and they were visible in the sky. Similarly, the queens of the royal family arrived on different palanquins. There were gorgeously decorated and protected by bodyguards. During this time, Lord Krishna, the maternal cousin of the Pandavas, and His special friend Arjuna, were both throwing the liquid substances on the bodies of the queens. The queens became bashful, but at the same time their beautiful smiling brightened their faces. Because of the liquid substances thrown on their bodies, the saris covering them became completely wet. The different parts of their beautiful bodies, particularly their breasts and waists, became partially visible because of the wet cloth. The queens also brought in buckets of liquid substances and sprinkled them on the bodies of their husbands. As they engaged in such jubilant activities, their hair fell loose, and the flowers decorating their bodies began to fall. When Lord Krishna, Arjuna and the queens were thus engaged in these jubilant activities, persons who were not clean in heart became agitated by lustful desires. Such behavior between pure males and females is enjoyable, but persons who are materially contaminated become lustful.
King Yudhisthira, in a gorgeous chariot yoked by excellent horses, was present with his queens, including Draupadi and others. The festivities of the sacrifice were so beautiful that it appeared as if Rajasuya was standing there in person with the functions of the sacrifice.
Following the Rajasuya sacrifice, there was the Vedic ritualistic duty known as patnisamyaja. This sacrifice was performed along with one's wife, and it was also performed by the priests of King Yudhisthira. When Queen Draupadi and King Yudhisthira were taking their avabhrita bath, the citizens of Hastinapura as well as the demigods began to beat on drums and blow trumpets out of feelings of happiness, and there was a shower of flowers from the sky. When the King and the Queen finished their bath in the Ganges, all the other citizens, consisting of all the varnas or castes--the brahmanas, the kshatriyas, the vaishyas, and the shudras--took their baths in the Ganges. Bathing in the Ganges is recommended in the Vedic literature because by such bathing one becomes freed from all sinful reactions.
After taking his bath, King Yudhisthira dressed in a new silken cloth and chaddar and decorated himself with valuable jewelry. The King not only dressed himself and decorated himself, but he also gave clothing and ornaments to all the priests and to the others who had participated in the yajnas. In this way, they were all worshiped by King Yudhisthira. He constantly worshiped his friends, his family members, his relatives, his well-wishers and everyone present, and because he was a great devotee of Lord Narayana, or because he was a Vaishnava, he therefore knew how to treat everyone well.
When everyone was refreshed after bathing and was dressed in silken clothing with jeweled earrings, flower garlands, turbans, long chaddars and pearl necklaces, they looked, altogether, like the denizens from heaven. This was especially true of the women who were very nicely dressed. Each wore a golden belt around the waist. They were all smiling. Spots of tilaka and curling hair were scattered here and there. This combination was very attractive.
Persons who had participated in the Rajasuya sacrifice--including the most cultured priests, the brahmanas who had assisted in the performance of the sacrifice, the citizens of all varnas, kings, demigods, sages, saints and citizens of the Pitriloka--were all very much satisfied by the dealings of King Yudhisthira, and at the end they happily departed for their residences. While returning to their homes, they talked of the dealings of King Yudhisthira, and even after continuous talk of his greatness they were not satiated, just as one may drink nectar over and over again and never be satisfied. After the departure of all others, Maharaja Yudhisthira restrained the inner circle of his friends, including Lord Krishna, by not allowing them to leave. Lord Krishna could not refuse the request of the King. He therefore sent back all the heroes of the Yadu dynasty, like Samba and others. All of them returned to Dvaraka, and Lord Krishna personally remained in order to give pleasure to the King.
In the material world, everyone has a particular type of desire to be fulfilled, but one is never able to fulfill his desire to his full satisfaction. But King Yudhisthira, because of his unflinching devotion to Krishna, could fulfill all his desires successfully by the performance of the Rajasuya yajna. From the description of the execution of the Rajasuya yajna, it appears that such a function is a great ocean of opulent desires. It is not possible for an ordinary man to cross over such an ocean; nevertheless, by the grace of Lord Krishna, King Yudhisthira was able to cross over it very easily, and thus he became freed from all anxieties.
When Duryodhana saw that Maharaja Yudhisthira had become very famous after performance of the Rajasuya yajna and was fully satisfied in every respect, he began to burn with the fire of envy because his mind was always poisonous. For one thing, he envied the imperial court which had been constructed by the demon Maya for the Pandavas. The court was excellent in its puzzling artistic workmanship and was befitting the position of great princes, kings or leaders of the demons. In that great palace, the Pandavas were living with their family members, and Queen Draupadi was serving her husbands very peacefully. And because in those s Lord Krishna was also there, the palace was also decorated by His thousands of queens. When the queens, with their heavy breasts and thin waists, moved within the palace, and their ankle bells rang very melodiously with their movement, the whole palace appeared to be more opulent than the heavenly kingdoms. Because a portion of their breasts was sprinkled with saffron powder, the pearl necklaces on their breast appeared to be reddish. With their full earrings and flowing hair, the queens appeared very beautiful.
After looking at such beauties in the palace of King Yudhisthira, Duryodhana became envious. He became especially envious and lustful upon seeing the beauty of Draupadi because he had cherished a special attraction for her from the very beginning of her marriage with the Pandavas. In the marriage selection assembly of Draupadi, Duryodhana had also been present, and with other princes he had been very much captivated by Draupadi's beauty, but he had failed to achieve her.
Shortly after the completion of the Rajasuya sacrifice, King Yudhisthira was sitting on the golden throne in the palace constructed by the demon Maya. His four brothers and other relatives, as well as his great well-wisher, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, were present and the material opulence of King Yudhisthira seemed no less than that of Lord Brahma.
While he was sitting on the imperial throne surrounded by his friends, and the reciters were offering prayers to him in the form of nice songs, Duryodhana, and his younger brother were marveling over the opulence of the palace created by the demon Maya. While wandering through the palace they came upon a crystal floor. The king mistaking it for a pool of water lifted up his royal robes. He appeared foolish for doing so, and when he learned the floor was not actually water, he appeared embarrassed and angry. Nonetheless, he continued to inspect the palace and suddenly came upon a crystal pool adorned with lotus flowers with crystal petals. This time he was convinced it was land; and as he walked forward, he fell into the lake and all his clothes became wet.
By the craftsmanship of the demon Maya, the palace was so decorated in different places that one who did not know the tricks would consider water to be land and land to be water. Duryodhana was also illusioned by this craftsmanship; and when he was crossing water thinking it to be land, he fell down. When Duryodhana, out of his foolishness, had thus fallen, Lord Krishna's queens enjoyed the incident by laughing. King Yudhisthira could understand the feelings of Duryodhana, and he tried to restrain the queens from laughing, but Lord Krishna indicated that King Yudhisthira should not restrain them from enjoying the incident. Krishna desired that Duryodhana might be fooled in that way and that all of them might enjoy his foolish behavior. Seeing Duryodhana fallen into the lake, Bhima laughed loudly. Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva also laughed at the foolishness of Duryodhana. When everyone laughed, Duryodhana felt very insulted, and his hair stood up in anger. Being thus insulted, he started to leave the palace, bowing his head. He was silent and did not protest. He again lifted up his clothes to pass over what he thought was water. Again it was only land and everyone laughed. Becoming more and more indignant, the king attempted to leave through a crystal door that he thought was open. When he bumped into the crystal door, he backed off with his brain reeling. He then went to another door and thinking it was a crystal door attempted to open it with his outstretched hands. The door was actually open and he fell down in his attempt. And coming upon another door that was really open, Duryodhana thought it was closed and went away from it.
When Duryodhana left in such an angry mood, King Yudhisthira regretted the incident, and became very sorry. But despite all occurrences, Krishna was silent. He did not say anything against or in favor of the incident. It appeared that Duryodhana had been put into illusion by the supreme will of Lord Krishna, and this incident increased the enmity between the two sects of the Kuru dynasty. It appeared that it was a part of Krishna's plan in His mission to decrease the burden of the world."
27,Sabha Parva,The Evil Plan,"After Duryodhana left Indraprastha, he was burning with envy. He could not stand to see the opulence of the Pandavas. After the incident of falling into the pond and hearing Bhima laugh at him, Duryodhana was determined to destroy the Pandavas. He confided in his uncle Shakuni, ""O uncle, the Kings of the earth are now subordinate to Yudhisthira due to the strength of Arjuna's Gandiva bow, given to him by Agni, the fire god. After completing the Rajasuya sacrifice, the Pandavas have brought all the kings of the world under their sway. This envy is burning my heart  and night. Did you see how Shishupala was killed by Krishna? Shishupala had no one to support him in that fight. The Pandavas are supported by Krishna and Balarama, and the whole Yadu and Vrishni dynasties. King Drupada and his sons have also taken their side. I cannot live seeing the Pandavas prosper. I will take poison or throw myself in fire, but I will not maintain my life while the Pandavas grow in opulence. With Karna, Drona, Bhishma, Kripa, and my brothers, I will attack them and take away their wealth. Let us quickly organize our troops and exterminate them.""
Shakuni, who was evil from birth, then gave the following foolish advice, ""Krishna, Arjuna, Yudhisthira, Bhima, Nakula, Sahadeva and Drupada and his sons can never be subjugated in battle even by the heavenly gods themselves. However, listen, O King, to the means by which Yudhisthira may be defeated. The son of Kunti, Yudhisthira, is very fond of playing dice, although he does not play well. If he is challenged, he will not refuse. I am skillful at dice, and there is no one on earth who is my equal. If I play for you, I can win the kingdom of the Pandavas with out shedding any blood. The dice will prove to be more deadly than the sword.""
""Let us present our plan to my father,"" Duryodhana joyfully responded, ""and then take the necessary action.""
When Duryodhana returned to Hastinapura, he informed his father through Shakuni that he was very morose and unhappy. Dhritarastra then called for Duryodhana and inquired from him, ""My dear son, why are you so unhappy. This vast wealth of mine is under your control. No one in this court opposes your desires. You have an opulent treasury, the finest food, the finest bed, the fastest horses and all these servants wait at your command. Therefore, do not be unhappy.""
Duryodhana replied to his father, ""I eat the finest foods and dress in the most opulent clothes, but these do not satisfy me for my heart is full of jealousy. Having seen Yudhisthira's prosperity, whatever I enjoy brings me no happiness. The opulence of Pandu's sons diminishes my pride, and I have become pale. Yudhisthira is supporting 88,000 brahmanas, and at his palace he is feeding them daily off golden plates. The King of Kambhoja has sent to him hundreds and thousands of she elephants and thirty thousand she-camels. O my father, the lords of the earth brought for Yudhisthira's pleasure heaps of jewels and gems, and unlimited amounts of gold. Thousands of chariots and horses of the finest quality were brought to the Rajasuya sacrifice. Never before have I seen or heard of such wealth. Even the heavenly gods do not possess such wealth. I think that Lord Brahma and Yudhisthira are now equal in their opulence. There was so much wealth brought to the Rajasuya sacrifice that it could not be brought into the Palace. It was left outside the palace to be dealt with at a later time. Seeing the great opulence of Yudhisthira, my heart burns and I cannot enjoy peace.""
At this time Shakuni, who possessed a wicked heart, offered ill advice to the King, ""My dear King, I know a way by which Duryodhana's heart may be pacified. I am very expert in gambling and throwing dice. Yudhisthira also likes to play, but doesn't play well. If Duryodhana challenges him to play at dice, I will throw the dice and secure their kingdom from them. Without any bloodshed the kingdom of the Pandavas will belong to Duryodhana.""
""I will consult Vidura, the possessor of great wisdom,"" Dhritarastra replied. ""After talking with him, I will inform you of the judgement in respect to this affair. However, I warn you not to be jealous of the Pandavas. He who becomes envious of anothers' wealth suffers the pangs of death. Yudhisthira does not know about deception, and therefore, always treats you as a friend. If he is not jealous of you, why should you be jealous of him? One who covets the possessions of others is never remembered in the records of history, but on other hand, one who strives to acquire his own wealth by honest means attains lasting fame. I look on both of you as my own sons, therefore give up this jealousy.""
""The Kings of Hastinapura are the Kings of the world,"" Duryodhana angrily replied. ""Is it not right to bring every direction under our rule? Isn't one who gives pain to another considered to be one's enemy? While I was walking in the assembly hall built by the demon Maya, I slipped and fell into the water. At that time Bhima laughed at me, and anger sprung up in my heart; and if Krishna had not been there, I would have slain Vrikodara. It is natural to have enemies and friends. They have been chosen by providence. The Pandavas are my determined enemies, and I will destroy them. I will not be content until I have accomplished this, O Bharata; do not let the opulence of the enemy increase. If you consult with Vidura, he will advise you to desist. And if you do not carry out this plan, I will kill myself. And when I am dead, you and Vidura can be happy without me.""
Hearing these painful words, Dhritarastra, through affectionate weakness for his son, gave the following order, ""Let an assembly house be constructed at Jayanta immediately. It must be built of the finest quality. The columns must be made of gold and the walls studded with the most precious gems. Report to me when it is complete.""
Dhritarastra then sent for Vidura and in private informed him of the deceptive scheme. The intelligent Vidura, when he heard of Shakuni's plan, knew that the age of Kali had arrived. He tried to persuade the blind King, ""O exalted King, I do not approve of this idea of a gambling match. You should act in such a way that no quarrels arise between your sons and the sons of your brother.""
""O Vidura,"" Dhritarastra replied, ""if the demigods are merciful to us nothing will happen in the gambling match. Besides it is a friendly gesture between cousins. As long as I am there along with Bhishma, Drona and Yourself, what harm can come? Therefore, go to Indraprastha and invite the Pandavas to Hastinapura. This is my resolution, and I do not want to hear anything more. I regard fate as supreme."" Hearing the words of the blind King, Vidura concluded that his dynasty was doomed and in great sorrow went to Bhishma to inform him of the affair.
Following Dhritarastra's order, Vidura went to Indraprastha, where he was received warmly by Yudhisthira and the others. After being given a comfortable seat, Yudhisthira inquired, ""You do not seem to be very happy. Are you not well? Is there someone in Hastinapura who is not in good health? Please tell us what is within your mind."" Vidura repeated the order given by Dhritarastra, the order to come and visit the new assembly hall built in Jayanta and to engage in game of dice.
""If we engage in a game of dice,"" Yudhisthira replied, ""we might quarrel. What do you think is the best policy for us to follow? We will pursue the counsel that you offer.""
""I know that gambling is the root of all evil,"" Vidura said. ""I tried to persuade the King to desist from this action, but he would not heed my advice. Shakuni, the King of Gandhara, is ready to play for Duryodhana. He is a great wizard at this game, and you will certainly lose. Knowing all this, judge for yourself what action to take.""
""It would seem"" Yudhisthira replied, ""that Duryodhana is determined to win our wealth by deceitful means. This whole cosmic manifestation is under the the control of higher authorities. No one is free to act in the way he pleases. I do not desire to gamble; however, it is the duty of a kshatriya to accept challenges in the matter of gambling and fighting. I cannot refuse them.""
After making his decision, Yudhisthira made arrangements for their journey to Hastinapura. The next  Yudhisthira, along with his brothers, set out for the capital of the Kurus, taking with them their queens and servants."
28,Sabha Parva,The Gambling Match,"The Pandavas soon arrived at Hastinapura, the Kuru capital, where they were offered a superficial welcome by Dhritarastra and supplied rooms that were beautifully furnished. They spent the night in those apartments, and the next  they were taken by Dhritarastra to the new imperial court at Jayanta. Following them were Duryodhana and his one hundred brothers, Shakuni and the other members of the Kuru race such as Bhishma, Somadatta and Bhurishravas. The Pandavas were shown the assembly hall, and out of courtesy the Pandavas expressed appreciation for the beauty of the royal assembly court. However, it did not measure up to the beauty of the imperial court built by the demon Maya. Duryodhana and his followers were indifferent to the assembly house; their minds were fixed on the gambling match.
After the hall had been inspected, Shakuni suggested that they sit down and play a game of dice. However, Yudhisthira advised, ""Gambling is deceitful, sinful, and there is no kshatriya prowess in it. When there is no morality in such action, why do you praise gambling in this way? The wise do not advise playing with one who is expert in dice. O Shakuni, do not try to subjugate us by deceitful means. Victory in battle without deception and wickedness is the mark of a true warrior.""
""It is from a desire to be victorious"" Shakuni replied, ""that one person approaches another for gambling. But such a desire is not really dishonest. One who is expert in gambling approaches another to defeat that person. Similarly, one who is the expert in the use of weapons approaches a weaker enemy with the idea of defeating him. This is the practice in every contest. The motive is victory. If you think that my intentions are deceptive, then you may desist from play.""
""Since you have challenged me,"" Yudhisthira said, ""I will not withdraw. This is my established vow. We are all under the control of destiny. Who in this assembly shall be my opponent? Who will match their skill against mine? Let the play begin.""
The scheming Duryodhana joyfully suggested, ""O monarch, I shall supply gems and jewels and every kind of wealth. However, my uncle Shakuni shall roll the dice for me.""
Not agreeing with the terms, Yudhisthira replied, ""Gambling for one's own sake is allowed, but a substitute is never sanctioned.""
""I see nothing wrong in this arrangement,"" Shakuni spoke up. ""It is evident that you want to avoid playing by offering some excuse. If you do not want to play, then tell us frankly."" Yudhisthira could not reply, and the game of dice began.
When the gambling match commenced, the hall filled up with princes and kings. Bhishma, Drona, Kripa and Vidura took their seats, but their hearts were not in this game. It was unprincipled and started with a sinsiter intention. King Dhritarastra also took his seat along with many others. They were anxious for the game to begin.
""O King,"" Yudhisthira said, ""here I have an excellent wealth of pearls, originated from the churning of the milk ocean. They are set in gold and radiant in beauty. What will you wager?""
""I have many jewels and own a great fortune,"" Duryodhana replied, ""but I am not proud of it. Throw the dice, and we will see who is the winner.""
Then Shakuni, a past master in the art of gambling, took up the dice and threw them exclaiming, ""Look, I have won!""
Yudhisthira then wagered, ""I have many dazzling jars of jewelry in my treasury, inexhaustible gold, and a mountain of silver and other minerals. This, O King, is the wealth that I will wager.""
Shakuni threw the dice and exclaimed, ""Look I have won!"" Time after time Yudhisthira would stake his wealth, and time after time Shakuni would win, and the only sound that could be heard was, ""Look I have won!"" Yudhisthira lost his jewels, his gold, his silver, his army, his chariots, his horses, his slaves and his kingdom. Yudhisthira kept losing steadily watching everything being devoured by the demon Shakuni.
During the course of the gambling, Vidura could see that the Pandavas were about to lose everything. He, therefore, tried to advise Dhritarastra, ""Dear brother, listen to my words, even if they are not pleasing to your ears. A sick man will not relish the medicine the doctor prescribes. Do you remember the time when this son of yours was born and brayed like a jackal. A jackal is living in your house in the form of Duryodhana. He will bring about the destruction of the Bharata race. At the time of his birth, I told you to cast him aside and save the Kuru dynasty, but you did not take my advice, and now you will have to pay heavily. This injustice in the form of a gambling match will not go unpunished. You will suffer greatly in old age because of the deaths of your sons at the hands of the Pandavas. Gambling is the foundation of all sin, and leads one to hellish life. Your son does not have the strength to fight with the Pandavas in a manly war. He is cheating them with the help of this prince of the cheaters. Please do not allow gambling match to continue, or it will have gruesome results. I urgently request you to stop this game."" This advice was bitter medicine the King did not want to take, and, therefore, he did not respond to Vidura.
However, Duryodhana heard Vidura's advice and responded harshly, ""O Vidura, you are always glorifying the sons of Pandu and neglecting us. You do not regard us as your children. Your tongue and mind are reflecting what is in your heart. You have been maintained by us like a serpent in our lap. The wise have said that there is no greater vice than to injure one's master. Why do you not fear this sin? We are now prevailing over our enemies, and we have now acquired great riches. Therefore, O parasite, why do you try to obstruct us? Do not imagine that you are our master. We did not ask you for your counsel, so why give it? One should not give shelter to another who is the friend of foes.""
Vidura then tried again to persuade his brother, ""I have always been a well wishing friend to you and your family, but this injustice will not be tolerated. I am not partial to any section of the family-either the sons of Pandu or your sons. However, I am partial to those who are honest and just, and indifferent to those who are dishonest and crooked. Your son, O King, is dishonest, and his actions are proving it. If you allow impious actions to continue, you will have to reap the impious repercussions that will come in the future. We have never seen in the history of the world honest kings acting like your son. On the contrary, only the most vindictive of wicked kings act in the way Duryodhana is acting. He is an enemy in your own camp. Therefore, at your command, O King, allow Arjuna to kill this unscrupulous person."" Again these words of wisdom fell on deaf ears and the gambling match continued.
By this time Shakuni had exploited everything and inquired of Yudhisthira, ""What now will you wager?""
""Here is my brother Nakula"" Yudhisthira replied, ""who is a powerful warrior. He is what I shall now stake in this gambling match.""
Saying this much Shakuni rolled the dice and said, ""Look, I have won. Now what will you bet?""
""Here is my brother Sahadeva,"" Yudhisthira replied, ""who knows all the principles of morality. He is my wager in this gambling match.""
Shakuni then rolled the dice exclaiming, ""Look Yudhisthira, I have won. Now what will be your wager? You still have Arjuna and Bhimasena.""
""O wretched person,"" Yudhisthira replied, ""you are cheating by playing a game of crooked dice. You are trying to create disunion between us who are of one heart. However, I am not the controller of destiny, and, therefore, I will wager this brother of mine Arjuna, who is the foremost archer in the world.""
Shakuni then rolled the dice and laughingly exclaimed, ""Look, I have won! Now what will you wager?""
""I have Bhima,"" Yudhisthira replied, ""who is capable of subduing all warriors on the field of battle. I will wager this brother of mine.""
Shakuni then pitched the dice and said, ""Look Yudhisthira, I have won. Now what is there left to wager?""
Yudhisthira then replied to the sinful Shakuni, ""I have myself who am the oldest of my brothers and who is the King of Indraprastha. I will wager myself.""
After saying this much, Shakuni rolled the dice and exclaimed, ""You have permitted yourself to be won, O King. Is there anything left for you to wager? I think you still have one thing left in your possession. Why don't you stake Draupadi in this gambling match. By her you can win yourself back.""
""The beautiful Draupadi"" Yudhisthira replied, ""is still in my possession. Making her as my wager, I will play with you, O best of the charlatans.""
When King Yudhisthira had made this last wager, there was a cry of anguish among the elders present. Bhishma, Drona and Kripa were covered with perspiration, and Vidura, holding his head between his hands, sat like one who had lost all reason. He sat with his face downward and was breathing heavily like a snake. Dhritarastra was the only one of the elders who was elated at heart. He repeatedly asked, ""What has been won? What now has been won?"" He could not conceal his emotions. Karna and Duhshasana were laughing loudly, but others were crying in the assembly. Picking up the dice that were loaded in his favor, Shakuni rolled them and exclaimed, ""Look, I have won everything!"" With these words the entire assembly hall was shocked into silence."
29,Sabha Parva,Lord Krishna Protects Draupada,"After obtaining Draupadi in the crooked game of dice, Duryodhana turned to Vidura and proudly said, ""Come, Vidura, bring Draupadi, the dear wife of the Pandavas. Let her enter the chambers meant for the serving maids. She must now sweep the palace floors and take the position suited for a menial servant.""
Outraged, Vidura replied, ""Do you not know, O fiend, that by speaking such words, you are strangling yourself with a rope? Do you not understand that you are standing on the edge of a cliff? You are like a deer trying to provoke tigers to rage. If you provoke the Pandavas further, you will certainly enter the regions of Yamaraja. It is my judgement that you cannot take Draupadi as a slave, for she has been won after Yudhisthira ceased to be his own master. Draupadi is not your slave, and you should not insult her. Yudhisthira had no right to use Draupadi as a wager when he had already lost himself. I am warning you against the terrible wrath of the Pandavas. If you do not heed my words, you will experience your demise, along with all your brothers and friends. Hell is already preparing to receive the host of the Kuru House.""
These words which were well spoken fell on deaf ears, and in unhappiness, Vidura said, ""What can I do? There is none so blind as one who will not see, and there is none so deaf as he who refuses to hear."" Vidura said no more.
Intoxicated with pride Duryodhana, the lowest among men ordered, ""We have heard enough from Vidura. Bring Draupadi here immediately!""
He then commanded the door guard, ""Bring Draupadi here. You have nothing to fear from the Pandavas. It is just Vidura who speaks like a madman, but who has no power. He is not in truth our well wisher.""
The doorguard then went to the chambers of Draupadi and informed her of the events that transpired, ""My dear queen of the Pandavas, your husband Yudhisthira, in the fever of gambling, has lost you in a bet with Duryodhana. You have now become the slave of Dhritarastra's son, and he wishes to see you in court to be put to work as a menial maidservant.""
Draupadi anxiously inquired, ""What kind of folly are you speaking? What King is there that would wager his own wife. He must certainly have been intoxicated with gambling or else how could he have done such a thing!""
""Yudhisthira, while gambling with Shakuni, lost all his wealth and kingdom,"" The doorguard replied. ""He then lost his brothers and then himself, and finally he lost you in the gambling match.""
""Go to the assembly hall,"" Draupadi requested, ""and ask Yudhisthira whom he lost first, himself or me. After finding this out, you may take me to the assembly hall.""
The messenger then came back to the assembly hall and repeated what Draupadi had said. He then addressed Yudhisthira, ""Draupadi has asked, 'Whose lord were you when you lost me in the gambling match? Did you lose yourself first or me?'"" Yudhisthira simply lowered his head and could not say anything like a person who had lost all reason.
""Let the princess of Panchala,"" Duryodhana ordered, ""come here and ask the question herself. Let everyone hear the words that are spoken between the queen and her husband.""
The doorkeeper then went again to Krishna (Draupadi) and told her all that was said. She then requested the guard, ""Go back again to the court and ask my husband what I should do. I will obey him and no one else.""
The servant then went to the assembly and repeated the request to Yudhisthira. Yudhisthira then ordered, ""Tell Draupadi that she should come here and ask her question to the elders present.""
Duryodhana then commanded the servant to go to the quarters and bring the princess at once. The doorkeeper, however, was afraid of Draupadi's wrath and was hesitant to go. Duryodhana then turned to Duhshasana and ordered him, ""O Duhshasana, this servant is afraid of these orders. Therefore, go yourself and forcibly bring her to our presence.""
Hearing the command of his brother, which was unknowingly meant for his death, Duhshasana went to chambers of the queen and taunted her, ""Come, come, O Krishna, princess of Panchala, you have been won by us. Come and accept the Kurus for your lords. You have been won fairly in a gambling match.""
Draupadi was distraught by the words of Duhshasana, and rising from her seat, she ran towards Gandhari's quarters. Duhshasana ran after her and grabbed her by her long black curly hair that had been sanctified by the Rajasuya sacrificial waters. He then forcibly dragged Draupadi by her hair into the assembly hall while she was crying out, ""My dear Lord Krishna, please save me! O my Lord, there is no shelter other than You!""
Duhshasana brought her into the assembly. Her clothes had been loosened, and her hair was no longer braided. She was terribly angry and screamed at Duhshasana, ""In this assembly there are persons who are conversant with all the branches of the Vedas and are equal to Indra. I cannot stand before them in this state. O wretched person, do not drag me before them. My husbands will not pardon you. The others in this assembly will not rebuke you, and therefore, they possess the same mentality. Surely there is no more virtue in the Bharata dynasty, nor are the codes of kshatriya practice any longer in use or else how could these so-called kshatriyas tolerate this action. Both Drona and Bhishma have lost their prowess, for this crime is going unpunished.""
Thus Draupadi cried in distress in the assembly, and casting a glance upon her enraged husbands, inflamed their hearts further. The Pandavas were not so distressed by the loss of there kingdom or wealth, as by that glance of Draupadi that was filled with anger and helplessness. And seeing Draupadi looking at her lords, Duhshasana dragged her more forcibly and addressed her, ""slave!, slave!"" and laughed aloud. Duryodhana, Karna and Shakuni also laughed to see Draupadi being pulled into the assembly.
Looking in the direction of the Kuru elders, she addressed Bhishma in the following words, ""You are the residence of learning and morality. They say there is none wiser that you. Can you tell me whether or not I am a slave?""
""I am, indeed, at a loss to give you a proper answer,"" Bhishma replied. ""Morality is very difficult to understand, and its laws are subtle. A man cannot wager something once he has lost himself. Therefore, Yudhisthira had no right to lose you. But then again a woman is always under the orders of her husband in all circumstances. He can call her his property even after he has lost himself. Accordingly, I can not surely say that you are free. Yudhisthira knew that Shakuni was a pastmaster in the art of gambling, and yet he played with him willingly enough. Though he was being defeated, Yudhisthira continued to play, and he used you as the wager. I am not able, therefore, to answer your question.""
Draupadi's eyes were red with anger, and she angrily said to Shantanu's son, ""The King was ordered to come to this charlatan's assembly, and he was made to play with this vicious, spineless Shakuni. How can it be said that he voluntarily chose to play? The chief of the Pandavas was deprived of his wealth by deceitful conduct. Here is this assembly are the elders of the Kurus. Let them decide what is to be done in this connection.""
Looking at Draupadi whose words were like fire, Duhshasana laughed loudly and called her names. He bellowed, ""You are the slave of Duryodhana; there is no need to consider the laws of Dharma. Your Dharma is to please your master Duryodhana.""
Seeing the Pandavas in such a distraught condition, Vikarna, one of Dhritarastra's sons, said to all assembled, ""Why is it that no one can answer Draupadi's question? If we do not judge the matter properly then we shall surely go to hell for our wrongdoing. How is it that Bhishma and Dhritarastra, who are the elders of the Kurus, do not say anything about this injustice? Why is it that Kripa and the son of Bharadvaja, Drona, do not say anything? If you will not say anything, then I will give my opinion in this regard. It is a well known fact that there are four vices of kings. That is hunting, drinking, gambling and too much attachment for women. The man that is addicted to these lives a life forsaking virtue. And people do not respect a King who is attached to sinful life. This son of Pandu, while forced to engage in one of these sinful acts, made Draupadi a wager. The King, having lost himself first, made Draupadi a wager, and the unscrupulous Shakuni with wicked intentions said that she could be made a wager. Reflecting on all these circumstances, I regard Draupadi a free woman and not a slave.""
Hearing these truthful words, a loud roar rose from those present in the assembly, and they applauded Vikarna for his clear thinking. However, Karna, deprived of his senses through anger, rebuked Vikarna as follows, ""Vikarna, you are only a boy, and your wisdom is childish. All the elders here are in agreement that Draupadi is a slave of the Kurus. If she were not a slave, do you think that her husbands would allow her to be brought into the royal court. You say that it is not right to call her a slave, but there is no need to consider Dharma in the case of the Pandavas. O son of the Kuru race, the sages have ordained only one husband for one woman. This Draupadi, however, has many husbands, and is certainly considered unchaste. Therefore, to bring her into this assembly in front of many men and see her stripped naked will not embarrass her. She is a slave just like her lords. They do not deserve the clothes they are wearing. Duhshasana, take off the upper garments of these men and also those of Draupadi."" Hearing the order of Karna, the Pandavas took off their upper garments and threw them on the floor.
The shameless Duhshasana then began to pull at the upper garments of Draupadi, and Draupadi tried to stop him while looking in the direction of her husbands. When she saw that they could do nothing to help her, she took shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the only one who can give shelter in all circumstances. She threw her hands into the air praying, ""O Govinda, O all pervading Lord of the universe, O Krishna, O Keshava, do You not see that I am being humiliated by the Kauravas. O husband of the goddess of fortune, O Lord of Vraja, You are present wherever Your devotees are singing Your glories. I surrender myself unto you! Please save me!"" Upon hearing the words of Draupadi, Lord Krishna, the Supersoul in everyone's heart, immediately offered protection to His devotee.
Draupadi stopped trying to resist the advances of Duhshasana and fixed her mind at the lotus feet of Lord Krishna. As Duhshasana pulled on the upper portion of her sari, the horrified audience looked on. The sinful demon was pulling at her clothes, but each time he pulled, the cloth was getting longer. The more he pulled, the more cloth there was, and soon there was a huge pile of cloth on the floor, enough for hundreds of saris. The kings present in the assembly began to applaud Draupadi and chastised the son of Dhritarastra with harsh words.
Seeing Draupadi in this humiliated condition, Bhima addressed the assembled kings, ""Please hear the words I have to say. I shall in battle tear open by force the chest of this sinful Duhshasana and drink his life blood. I take this oath, and if not accomplished, I shall not attain the regions of my ancestors."" All the warriors present acclaimed Bhima's vow and began to condemn Duryodhana and his followers. At that time Vidura spoke to those present in the assembly. He tried to convince them that the Vikarna's statements were truthful and that Draupadi was not a slave. No one responded to the words of Vidura for fear of Duryodhana.
When there was again silence in the assembly hall, Karna ordered Duhshasana, ""Take away this maidservant to the inner chambers."" Duhshasana forcibly grabbed Draupadi and began dragging her on the ground while she was crying and trembling. Draupadi broke away from him and addressed Bhishma again with the same question, ""I am the wedded wife of the Pandavas. Please answer my question. Am I a servant maid or otherwise? This cruel Duhshasana is treating me harshly. I cannot bear this any longer. I will accept your decision, whatever it may be.""
Hearing these lamentable words, Bhishma answered, ""I have already said, O blessed lady, that the answer to this question of morality is equivocal. I am unable to answer the question that you have put forward. However, it is certain that all the Kauravas have become slaves to greed and deceitfulness. Because of this offensive act, the end of the Kuru race is close at hand. The other Kuru elders who sit with their heads down, like persons who have left their bodies, cannot answer your question. However, if you ask Yudhisthira, he will answer your question about whether you are a slave or not.""
With a smirk on his face Duryodhana addressed Draupadi, ""The answer to your question depends on your husbands. Let them declare in the midst of respectable persons whether Yudhisthira is their lord.""
Bhima then spoke to the assembled warriors of the earth, ""If this great King of the earth, Yudhisthira, were not our lord, we would never have forgiven the Kuru race for this incident. If he says that he has become a slave, then we too have become slaves. If this were not so, then I would have already crushed to death the one who has touched the hair of the princess Draupadi. I am restraining myself due to respect for my older brother and the requests of Arjuna. However, If Yudhisthira commands me, I will kill all of Dhritarastra's sons immediately.""
Hearing the anger of Bhimasena, Duryodhana began to make fun of him. Laughing all the while, Duryodhana said to Yudhisthira, ""O King, your brothers and Draupadi are waiting for an answer to this question. Please state whether Draupadi is my slave or still your wife.""
After taunting him with these words and not receiving a reply, Duryodhana said, ""Draupadi, I will answer your question. You are free and you may chose any amongst the great warriors for your husband."" Duryodhana then laughed loudly; and when he saw that he had the attention of Bhima, he lifted his cloth and showed his naked thigh to Draupadi.
Seeing this, Bhima was overcome with an animosity that resembled universal devastation. He expanded his red eyes and declared to all assembled, ""I say to all present that I shall break the thighs of Duryodhana, or else I shall never attain the higher regions after this life!""
Karna laughed at Bhima and said to Duhshasana, ""Do not wait any longer. Take this maidservant Draupadi to the inner chambers."" Duhshasana began to drag her away while she appealed to all the elders in the Kuru house, but it was no use.
Then Bhima again took a vow, ""I am going to kill this sinful Duryodhana, and my brother Arjuna is going to kill Karna. This deceitful Shakuni will be killed by my brother Sahadeva. I take a vow that this will happen. I will kill Duryodhana and place my foot upon his head. I will also surely drink the blood of Duhshasana.""
Arjuna then confirmed Bhima's vow, ""Bhima, those who are living secure in their homes can never understand the danger that awaits them outside. Your words will come true. The earth will drink the blood of these four: Duryodhana, Duhshasana, Shakuni and Karna. There is no doubt about it.""
Arjuna then took an oath, ""I declare in the presence of all the kings assembled: I will kill this Karna and all his followers in a future war. I will kill all who are foolish enough to support him. The Himalayan mountains may move from their place, or the sun may fall out of its orbit, or the moon may lose its coolness, but I will never give up this vow until it is accomplished.""
Sahadeva then addressed the assembly with his vow, ""Shakuni, you are the lowest of men and a disgrace to the good name of the Gandharas. Because of your deception at dice, I swear that I will kill you and all your kinsmen. I hope that you will have the same courage on the battlefield that you have exhibited here in this gambling match.""
Nakula then made his vow, ""My brothers have sworn to kill their opponents. I promise in the presence of all assembled that I will kill the son of Shakuni, Uluka. All these persons mentioned will die on the battlefield.""
After the Pandavas said this much, a jackal began to cry loudly in the assembly hall of Dhritarastra's palace. And when the jackal howled, the asses began to bray in response, indicating the loss of all good fortune to the Kauravas. All the elders present understood the meaning of those evil omens. To late in the  Dhritarastra, realizing the seriousness of the situation, admonished his son, ""You have a wicked mind Duryodhana, and your downfall is sooner than you think. You have insulted the Pandava's wife, and certainly there is no hope for you.""
Dhritarastra then spoke to Draupadi, hoping to console her and save the life of his relatives, ""Please ask of me, O princess of Panchala, any benediction that you desire.""
Draupadi replied, ""I ask that my husband Yudhisthira be freed from slavery.""
Dhritarastra granted the request and said, ""You may take another benediction from me.""
Draupadi said, ""Please grant me that my husbands: Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva be freed from their bondage and their kingdom returned.""
Dhritarastra granted the benediction and asked Draupadi to take a third benediction. Draupadi replied, ""I will not ask for a third benediction. It has been said that a vaishya may ask one boon, a warrior two, and a brahmana may ask a hundred. Now that my husbands have been released from their bondage, they will be able to achieve prosperity by their own virtuous acts.""
Karna then snickered and said to all assembled, ""Fortunately for the Pandavas, Draupadi has become like a boat to save them from drowning in the ocean. They are indeed fortunate to be saved by a woman.""
Ignoring the taunts of Karna, Yudhisthira approached Dhritarastra with joined palms requesting, ""O King, you are our master. Command us as to what we should do. We desire to remain always obedient to you.""
""O Ajatrashatru,"" Dhritarastra replied, ""you are a blessed person. Go in peace to your kingdom and be happy. Take with you all your wealth. I am pleased with you humility and meekness. Where there is intelligence, there is tolerance. They are the best of men who do not remember the hostility of their enemies, that see the merits and not the faults of their foe. O child, do not remember the harsh words of Duryodhana. It was for seeing who were my friends and examining the weaknesses of my sons, that I allowed this gambling match to go on. O King, those among the Kurus, who have you for their ruler and Vidura for their counsellor, have, indeed, nothing to grieve for. Please, return now to Indraprastha, and let their be brotherly love between yourself and my sons.""
After receiving permission from King Dhritarastra, that crest jewel of the Bharatas, King Yudhisthira, took leave of the Kuru elders and left the city of Hastinapura. He was accompanied by his brothers and the beautiful Draupadi."
30,Sabha Parva,"The Pandavas Lose Their Kingdom","After the sons of Pandu had returned to their kingdom, Duhshasana went to his brother Duryodhana and complained, ""After we had won the kingdom and made slaves of the Pandavas, our father has thrown it away. Call them back for another dice game and take their kingdom, before they have time to organize their forces and challenge us."" Hearing Duhshasana agreeable words, Duryodhana, Shakuni and Karna, who were guided by lust and greed, united together and went to Dhritarastra with another dice match in mind.
Sitting respectfully before his father, Duryodhana spoke, ""If, with the wealth of the Pandavas, we satisfy the Kings of the earth, then the Pandavas cannot harm us. The Pandavas are now like hot-tempered venomous serpents, and they are surely arranging to challenge us to battle. Upon leaving Hastinapura, Arjuna was grasping his bow, fiercely looking in all directions. Vikrodara, after ascending his chariot, was seen leaving the city whirling his mace. Nakula was holding a sword and shield and was prepared for war. Sahadeva and Yudhisthira have ascended their chariots with an anger like that of Yamaraja. Having been persecuted, they will not forgive us. Who among them can forget the insult to Draupadi? Therefore, before they become too powerful, we should again call them for a gambling match and exile them to the forest. Whoever wins at the game of dice must enter the forest for twelve years, and the thirteenth year must be spent in concealment. If they are recognized in the thirteenth year, they must again go to the forest for another twelve years. Either we or they shall live so. Shakuni will again throw the dice and win for us. Even if they succeed in observing the vow, we shall, in the meantime, have won the citizen's favor and the respect of the worldly kings. Having gathered a vast army, we will defeat them in battle. This plan we present before you, O King.""
Dhritarastra, under the influence of all-devouring time, agreed with their proposal, and said, ""Call back the Pandavas and let them again play for the sake of the kingdom.""
Upon hearing Duryodhana's plan, Drona, Bhishma, Somadatta, Bahlika, Vidura, Bhurishravas and the son of Dhritarastra, Vikarna all said, ""Do not agree with this plan, O King. Let their be peace between your sons and the sons of Pandu."" Dhritarastra did not listen to their wisdom and summoned Pandu's sons to again gamble at dice.
It was at this time that the virtuous Gandhari approached her husband pleading, ""When Duryodhana was born, the wise Vidura advised you, 'It would be better to kill this child than let him live, for he will spoil the whole Kuru race.' This son of ours cried upon his birth just like a jackal. It is not too late, even now, to cast him aside. The kingdom that you will obtain by crooked means will soon be wrenched from you.""
When addressed in truthful words by his queen, Dhritarastra replied to her, ""If the devastation of our dynasty has come, let it take place. I have not the power to control providence. Rather destiny is my master, and I am its servant. Let the Pandavas return and again gamble with my sons.""
A messenger then approached Indraprastha, and in the presence of the Pandavas, gave the command of Dhritarastra. Yudhisthira could not refuse the order and again prepared to go to Hastinapura, knowing well the outcome of the gambling match. They again entered Hastinapura and sat down in the assembly hall to play another game of dice. The conniving Shakuni then said, ""The King has given back your property and that is all well. But this time, O bull of the Bharata race, we will wager in the following manner. Who ever wins at one throw of the dice will see his opponent enter the forest for twelve years and a final year spent in disguise. If discovered in the thirteenth year, one has to again enter the forest for another twelve years. O Yudhisthira, with this as the wager, play with us at dice.""
Yudhisthira, knowing well that a great karmic destruction of the Kuru dynasty was at hand, agreed with the proposal saying, ""O Shakuni, how can a King like myself refuse when challenged to play dice? Therefore, let the play begin."" Shakuni then took up the dice and cast them saying, ""I have won.""
When the Pandavas were defeated, they took off their royal dress and were given deer-skins as their garments. Duhshasana was very pleased with Shakuni's victory and announced to all assembled, ""The absolute sovereignty of King Duryodhana has now begun. The sons of Pandu have been defeated and our goal has now been achieved. O Draupadi, what will you gain by following these men into the forest. Now is the time to pick a husband from among those heroes of the Kuru race. Why wait upon these poor men any longer?""
Upon hearing Duhshasana's distasteful words, Bhima approached him like a tiger chasing a deer and boldly said, ""As you are piercing my ears with these arrow like words, I will pierce your heart on the field of battle and drink your blood. O spineless person, you have won only by the cheating methods of the Gandhara King. When I return from the forest, I will make good my vow.""
Duhshasana laughed at Bhima's anger and began to dance around him saying, ""O cow! O cow!"" Bhima was forced to hold back his fury, but he did so being bound by the cord on proper behavior.
Yudhisthira then approached the blind King and said, ""I bid farewell to you as well as Bhishma, Drona, Kripa and the others. I will again return after the thirteen year exile is finished.""
Overcome with shame, none of those men could look at Yudhisthira or say anything to him. However, within their hearts they prayed for his welfare. Vidura then said, ""Kunti is a princess by birth, and she should not go to the forest. I will keep her here in Hastinapura and protect her from any harm just as if she were my mother. O Yudhisthira, know that one who has been vanquished by sinful means need not be pained by such defeat. You also know every law of morality. Dhananjaya will be victorious in battle; Bhimasena will kill his enemies; Nakula will gain great wealth; and Sahadeva will obtain his goals. With learned brahmanas accompanying you to the forest, you need not fear anything. Draupadi will also assist you in your exile. You are all attached to one another and feel happiness in each others association. Go now, and we will again see you returned here safely and crowned with success."" The Pandavas then left Hastinapura much to the distress of the citizens and those relatives who loved them very much.
Now that the Pandavas has had left for the forest, Dhritarastra could not find peace of mind. He called for Vidura and questioned him, ""Please tell me in what state of mind the Pandavas left Hastinapura. I desire to hear everything, O Ksatta [Vidura].""
Vidura then replied to the King, ""Yudhisthira, though robbed of his kingdom and wealth, he has not deviated from the path of virtuous kings. He has left Hastinapura blindfolded, or else with the anger of his eyes, he would have burned the whole city to ashes. Bhima has left the city stretching his mighty arms indicating to everyone that upon his return he will destroy your sons with his prowess. And Arjuna, the son of Kunti, has left Hastinapura scattering grains of sand indicating that upon his return he will rain arrows from the might of his Gandiva bow. Sahadeva has left the city smearing his body with dirt so that none will recognize his plight and take action against your sons, O King. Nakula has left the city in the same way. Draupadi has left the city Hastinapura dressed in one cloth and her hair unbraided indicating that upon her return, her husbands will destroy the Kuru host, and the wives of those who insulted her will have to dress in the same way. The learned Dhaumya has left the city walking in front of the Pandavas holding kusha grass and chanting mantras from the Sama Veda which relate to Yamaraja. This indicates that when the host of the Kurus are slain in battle, the priests of the Kurus will chant the Soma mantras for the benefit of the deceased. And also, O King, the citizens seeing the Pandavas leaving are cursing you and your family. Upon their leaving many evil omens appeared: flashes of lightning in the cloudless sky, the earth trembled, and Rahu began to devour the sun. Meteors fell from the firmament, and jackals began to howl. Birds like the crows began to shriek, indicating the destruction of the Kuru house.""
While Dhritarastra and Vidura were thus talking with one another, the great sage Narada Muni appeared on the scene. He appeared in the Kuru's imperial court and spoke the following omen, ""On the thirteenth year from to, on account of Duryodhana's offenses, the Kauravas will be crushed by the prowess of Bhima and Arjuna."" Having said this much, the great sage Narada ascended by the airways; and the Kurus, who were left speechless, contemplated the awesome words of the rishi.
Fearful upon hearing the prophecy of Narada, Duryodhana along with Shakuni and Karna approached Drona and offered him the kingdom, considering him their protector. Drona then instructed them, ""The brahmanas have said that the Pandavas, being of celestial origin, are incapable of being slain. However, because you have sought my shelter, I will act as your protector, but know that the cause is doomed. I have formerly deprived Drupada of his kingdom, and in revenge he has performed a sacrifice with the help of the brahmanas, Yaja and Upayaja, and thus he has received a son who will kill me. It is already known that the fire-born Dhristadyumna will slay me in battle. His birth is celestial, and he was born with golden armor and weapons. I am but a mortal of this world. Drupada and his followers have taken up the Pandava's cause. Enjoy your kingdom for a short while, O Duryodhana. When the Pandavas return from the forest, a great catastrophe will befall you."""
